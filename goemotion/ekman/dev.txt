Thanks for sharing. I've actually been to the Allen.	3
Yeah nice one dude	3
This is exactly what I’ve been thinking!	3

But we're just trying to diffuse the tension and teach them about peace!	3
I feel like this is coming to NV soon as well, and I’m not so sure about how it will go	5
Feel free to use as many rhymes as you want, after all you have the final say of your word play.	3
[NAME] at 2.38 against Moicano seems like excellent value for me	3

Not bad at all.	3

Thanks. I needed this reminder today.	3
Are they bigger than our defensive breakdowns and [NAME] five hole?	5
Why are you taking a picture of a playground? Lol	3

Oh yeah I know, but like.. _why?_ it just seems like such a waste of his time.	5
Thanks!!	3
It's riskier to take on bad contracts right now	2
If this is actually how it goes, I won’t feel so bad going from 5 to 8 in week 17.	4
I still play	3
I like the reference to the Good Place :)	3
Oh, he isn't dead, [NAME]	5
The guy next to him's reaction face is classic.	3
Oh, hey what's up dude? Haven't seen you around in a while bro. Glad to see your still here.	3
It would probably be horrifying if we tried, when a bug causes an integer overflow and resets our aggression levels.	2
It looks like they do but random redditors do not. What a surprise.	5
Beautiful face, but scenically over the top	3
Halep just can’t handle Kanepi, #1 is about to be wide open	4
Ah, the original turd burger.	3
Haha thanks for the warning but we met with her irl before :D	3
This is funny but is it a meme or just a dude’s cool selfie ?	5
It does look good!	3
Can you even imagine the brain damage required to think like that? [NAME].	0
I dislike the shade he’s been throwing to our franchise and his inability to take responsibility for the reasons why he was traded	0
Thank you. Ignore the morons who have never heard of lactose intolerance.	3
Wow [NAME] has a lot more insecurities than I thought	5
Thanks, going to check them out next time i make something like chilli	3

Poor kitty! I’m sure she’ll feel okay again soon. Lots of TLC in order	3
[NAME] should be sticking that to the other side of the keeper, strange decision to go for that corner	0
I love that both replies to you are correct. It can be hard to tell cars apart. But also she probably wasn't paying attention.	3
I never said they were emotionless	0
And let me guess, is our friend [NAME] also shilling his own coin that solves all the problems?	5
Look at me! I care about animals!	3
This. Right here. This is what r/exmormon is...and it is beautiful.	3
Hard Candy. You're welcome.	3
That was indeed a good joke. My penis is happy	3
How can someone be so stupid to post that online, let alone publicly do that	0
Trust me, you can anthropomorphize anything and fuck it. Or at least, that’s what the internet has taught me.	3
I'm definitely feeling like it's been a never ending hurting fest, so I hope you're right.	3
I agree w that.	3
Pretty sure he's just quoting a song lyric lol source:	3
@lies_about_flossing, sorry if I used the wrong pronoun.	4

I enjoy fixing problems. I think of it as a task that I can achieve. People get to overworked when they set too unreachable goals.	3
I don't think any [RELIGION] woman would care about such a thing. If they did then they have their own problems.	0
So now we have [NAME] King and The Prince. Nice. I'm not even mad with this transfer lol	3

Thank you so much for all this! Nobody else seemed to understand the situation and just tell me to eat better, which I already do.	3

That ET one looks like he has stuck his finger is some strawberry jello or something and is disgusted that some has stuck to his finger!	1
Top female players including [NAME] practice against college men players and get beat a lot by them. I wouldn't be suprised to see [NAME] win even at 14..	5
It's less about what actually happened. What's done is done. I just want her to know why sexual exclusivity was so important to me	3
[NAME] always makes my day when he's yelling at the refs	3

With Everyday passing day without a good signing I feel like we got robbed in this trade	4
OK, is there a crossover between herb and spice in your language (Norwegian?) I was confused by 'North American Provence spice'.	5
I agree. I've been passively thinking that the left and right axis is irrelevant. Its north and south that divides	3
I absolutely love him. He is one of the two people that I enjoy playing. He has one of the most unique move sets and I like that	3

Glasses and [NAME] made me regain interest in the show. Pluuus I want to know what happens to [NAME], she's my favourite character :(	5
I personally believe [NAME] is asexual, other characters in simillar situations all get hints toward homosexuality but I can't remember any for [NAME].	3

Right. Lol Then they try to gaslight the audience. As if we cant pause and rewind.	3
WHAT A SHIFT!!! Can't stop that zone.	5
Wanting America to be better does not mean hating America. We can do better than [NAME]. He’s an embarrassment to the entire country.	4
You thought wrong. Also, the answer is Caribbean Splash Car Wash on Clarksville Pike. I'm not even kidding.	0

The thought of him having to schedule me in really turns me off and makes me sad. Has the reduced gaming time helped with intimacy in any way?	4

what are you doing here, [NAME]	5
The best champagne	3
Man, I wish Fed was still 26 for these matches lol	3
Haha I was about to say damn she straight up eviscerated her in between bites.	3
Crazy how [NAME] being a POS had been factual since the 90s but he’s only now feeling the consequences of his actions	5
Eh, you can't really judge his character solely on the appearances he makes on his GF's IG without making a ton of presumptions	0
What fun is this?? I love it!	3

They did this at one of my jobs. The icing on the 'fuck you cake' was the drivers' last day was 4 days before Christmas.	0
Remember they are an ex for a reason. Seeing that smile probably made you remember all the happy times	3
This is the truest statement I’ve ever read about [NAME]. May he smile mercifully upon you.	3

The only part of church I'm sad my kids will miss.	4
Right, that makes sense! I wonder if the person I met in real life would acknowledge he's more of a fence sitter than childfree, haha	5

I apologise for coming off as rude, the end comment was unnecessary and needlessly rude	0
For fuck sake... just go and remind them it's the quiet train!	0
The old “I had sex with your mom” joke. I chuckled a little.	3
What a good pupper	3
Hope [NAME] is watching this but he's probably too busy snorting some lines	3
It was a joke long before the meme haha	3
I stand corrected! But, if that's the case, who is the world's second most famous groundhog (assuming [NAME] remains #1)?	3
We don't. That is exclusively a leftist thing, and you know it.	0
Wow, thanks! Now i am rich again!	3

Congratulations on the job interview! NParents seem to give the absolute *worst* job advice. I'm glad that you've figured that out earlier than I did!	3
Pretty sure it’s a reference to Netflix’s “Bird Box” movie. In which case - brutal; I love it.	3
Im actually going to this game! One of the only chances every year I have to see the boys play in person. LET GO DEVILS	3
Give her weed to make her asexual and want to have sex with you. Great [NAME] logic.	3
That is odd.	1
There were a surprising amount of surprised pikachus in this thread—thanks for the edit all the same.	5
This is actually so funny, this is something id expect from Australian sports media since we're shit at broadcasting but lmao	3

This is the most Chicago music video I think I’ve ever seen and I love it. Classic song!	3
I feel like the last two seasons made me detach from the show.	4
I really hope not. Personally I have no interest in VR games, and not even my favorite game would change that.	3
Its probably just related to something she is dealing with. Stress/anxiety often causes nightmares. But there are plenty of potential	3
Lol Yes Most people arent 100% either (especially women). For a variety of reasons...finding beauty in other people, curiosity, jealousy, etc...	3
I've seen guys who didn't know each other start conversations about sports. It all seemed very effortless.	4
Well I mean Australia is a good example of this working isn’t it ?	3
That sex doesn't exist and we're all just pretending for his benefit...	0
I like you. No promo	3
No, that's not possible. If you have proof then it's not misinformation what your spreading but simply information.	0
I’m very happy for you! Congrats! 😁	3
I think there is a reality to that. Some of the focus has shifted to policing the language at the expense of dealing with more fundamental issues.	3
Now you move onto personal insults. Well done O king of the waffles. Once again using a word (nuance) with no context. Bored now.	0
“You fight like my sister!” “I’ve fought your sister! That’s a compliment!”	3

Honestly wish [NAME] would just stop taking threes all together. They just don’t fall for him.	3
You said you will turn 16 next year, this summer isnt next year	0
Honestly it makes me sad but [NAME] does need less time:/	4
[NAME], if you're doing an Undertale deal, not having a red heart on your ass is inexcusable.	0
The fact that [NAME], the other principal in the original story, has gotten out of this unscathed is annoying.	0
AP can tell them to leave, and then call the cops if they don't. Soliciting/begging is not allowed on Target property.	0
Well good luck and have fun!	3
OMG! I can only imagine. I've gotten it into a hang nail before and that was NOT fun.	5
Of course he does lol. Not very often, but he definitely has to block from time to time.	3

My dad doesn’t believe in climate change. This is way too accurate.	0
Still very curious who this woman is and what she looks like	5
Because [NAME] had a foot injury that I think he sustained at practice for the second half of the year.	4
tbh i would've guiltied but atleast they didnt lose an important TP	4
What the heck? $3 a month for 30 texts? That's ridiculous.	0
Alright, I'm all ears as to what the HUGE difference is.	3
"My first messages from women are either ""hi"" ""hello"" or ""psst."" Yeah I'm not wasting my time."	3
No offense, but you are jumping in conclusions that may be as incorrect as blaming [NAME].	0
Yep. Happy New Years!	3
Was he really [NAME] though? Even if he wasn't made up by the early church I doubt it.	5
Yeah it helps me too but I still don't feel well rested the next day	3
I think I should try this. Thanks, OP.	3
Thanks, so that's not what I need then.	3
The tree actually moved!!! Who is this guy?!	5
The stories where he meets and talks shit to [NAME] are some of the best!	3
Didn't know you're that close of a friend.. very cool!	3

She was such a pretty girl, she didn’t need to get all those surgeries. What a shame.	3

I thought about it but I wanted a sub that didn't exist.	3
These are so handy for quick reference to when they play, thanks for posting!	3

I mean for once the unpopular one is actually at the top, even if it is tea, robbed of air time? Sure, wins no	5
So many questions unanswered. Poor guy.	3
These videos are legendary	3

We have 9 home games which is awesome.	3

That [NAME] block on the [NAME] TD was awesome. He sealed the left side with authority.	3
In my eyes 6 La Liga’s in a span of 18 years is just embarrassing	4
That doesn't mean they're impossible. Minnesota's 7th district is 64% rural, R+12, and represented by [NAME], a [NAME].	3
That makes sense. You had a good reaction time. Glad no one was hurt.	3
I am even more concerned now[](#face-support)	3
To show themself in public like that they never did grow up. A 11 year old in a 25 year old body. Sad, really.	4
Only 7? Wow he's slacking. He must not have very faithful parishioners.	5

"[NAME] damn son. the fact that you said ""re-education"" made this 5x better too lmao "	3
"> I firmly believe ""[NAME] have problems, [NAME] ARE problems! Holy shit, stealing this. Love it."	3

My boyfriend is so much like your husband. I’m so happy for you to have him, he sounds wonderful.	3
So many [NAME] killed in Hoi An. [NAME] damn do I love that exchange rate.	4
You must be new! it's TASM around these parts.	3
My [NAME] He is a BEAST. Every possession he makes someone his bitch. Are there any injury concerns past the injury he got before he left the team?	3
Nope this whole thing has been deleted and we’re all banned. We are all now posting from the Shadow Realm.	0
Good job fatty!	3
Please do not take that personally. I thought this was a great photo.	3
That's not really libertarianism, is it?	5
Look at [NAME] and you should be good, he has a career like 58% GB rate	3

This is what I love about cats	3
I am really sad because my innocent nieces are brainwashed by my crazy sister	4

You cant love this girl if she already has a GF whom she sounds like she loves. You'll just ruin a relationship	0
Get out more. Make more friends and better friends. Don’t self-harm. Write my journal more often.	3

[NAME] uh...gave me a wake up call. Thank you	3
This is all the creativity you folks could muster today? Up is down and red is blue? I was hoping for a little more effort. r/terribletrollisterribleattrolling	3
Wow! I can save $15 and buy this used version?!?!? How wonderful!	5

That's [NAME]!	3
That is not a side swipe. That's a full on t-bone. But I hope they all made it through somehow.	3
I’m afraid too. It’s the not knowing what will happen that scares me.	2

A fucking centaur	0

I like [NAME], not so much	3

I love your comment...	3
Gotcha. That can happen sometimes too but make sure you follow up with your gyno just incase.	3
[NAME] earned it I think. He was godlike at world's. But [NAME] is the absolute worst S+ on this list.	5
Thanks, just bought this!	3
Juul is heavy vapor. Idk how to describe it but i didnt feel like that when i used other juices	5
I agree. Pockets especially on dresses just feel weird.	3
Yeah, too many blind assumptions. I'm just happy that we're getting four additional characters to pad the roster with.	3
What? You don't know what punishment is?	5
Great quote for a fictional universe in which you can speak with ghosts of the deceased. Sadly doesn’t offer comfort here.	3

Here Hope that helps!	3
Thank you for your kind words! Your energy is contagious!	3
I’m autistic and frankly this is disgusting. To say this about your child implies autism basically makes you worthless.	1

You. I like you	3
Oh I got one are you overweight	5
Man I am so happy for [NAME], they are selling out. Personally there is no way I would be able to afford them for 38$	3

Good luck and wear condom	3
