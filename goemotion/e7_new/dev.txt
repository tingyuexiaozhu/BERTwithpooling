I prefer to pay for my hugs, higher quality.	4
Which is exactly the point capt obvious.	4
I've seen guys who didn't know each other start conversations about sports. It all seemed very effortless.	5
Well I mean Australia is a good example of this working isn‚Äôt it ?	3
That sex doesn't exist and we're all just pretending for his benefit...	0
