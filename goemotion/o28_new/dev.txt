>when you're a day older than your friends on your 18th birthday ich believe I'm a bit too old for you!	27
What really? I cant believe no one has ever said that before! You may have saved my life.	26
I am assuming since it's shut down, no one can access the website to change these things. They are most likely delayed.	27

That's why I specified 'current attack.' I know it's gone on for ages.	27
Oh I thought it was something that was actually contemplated. My bad	12
Just starting watching , what happened ? See we’re about to be down by 20 	7
Please ask it! We're curious now and chances are it isn't nearly as creepy as you think!	7
Homegirl has been my favorite since season 1. Just like [NAME] on Laguna Beach. Maybe bc they remind me of myself. 😬😬😬👀👀👀	18
Something new! Finally...	27
I’m gonna sit down and cry now	25
I hate that we cant be trusted to self criticize and we have to have Russian news do it. It feels like watching fox.	9
We're sleep walking into, in the words of the Bank of England, a disordely Brexit. It's a bit problematic.	9
If you can keep it from going out / someone putting you out, yes. 	27
I miss [NAME]. Shame he had to get injured while he was here	9
Alright then, I'm glad to hear that. I hope it's handled in any case.	20

There used to be a group of local kids that would take pears from the tree in my back garden and throw them at people's houses.	27
No way dude. The Wilpons’ are so cheap that the Twitter guy is also the contract guy. (Was that a good Twitter impression?)	10
Who cares, you’re just showing what a racist pos you are. Carry on doing our work for us.	27
Each season gets better and better with season 3 or something you should go back and see what happened.	27

Has to be [NAME] doesn't it? 3 [NAME] in the squad with another on trial, plus they're pretty shit this season.	3
But it looks so fluffy	18
That must be so frustrating. Sounds like he’s digging his heels in and refusing to accept his faults.	2
Not really if they are busy. They may not even take a break. But again if they are regularly not responding than it is probably an issue.	10
bored waiting for the game [NAME]	9
How pretentious do you have to be to say “idk if you know who that is tho” after saying what your favourite band is	27
That's awesome! Congratulations to the both of you!	0
And he even dared to reference fairly odd parents in there, wtf lol	1

I thought it was British, oh well.	27
I’ll do that. Thank you	15
oops, back in a minute, your round!	27
I just love the look of most benzos. Bars of course the most. But a handful of 10mg valiums or 2mg klonopin is also mouth watering :)	18
Stop having kids you can't afford. Make sure you check the kids credit to make sure there are no accounts opened in their name. Good luck!	20

The problem is trying to find that middle ground, where there is just enough to prevent anarchy while still allowing people to pursue their desires.	27
No, but when you're family sees, like, 12 books of it, it can certainly make things awkward.	12
Yes indeed, the “just a joke, bro” ship sailed long ago. 	1

Someone else mentioned the council of Rome (382), but I’ll look into Carthage (397) and Hippo (393). Thank you!	15

You’re using the failing of someone else as an excuse to make the same mistake yourself	3
That's just a bad close-out, gotta know [NAME] is bating for those.	27
I feel bad for all those kids whose parents decided to homeschool them so they could be professional HOTS players without all that stupid learning getting in the way.	9

"I am so thrilled that you broke through that constraining ceiling, or that ""tunnel vision""."	26
The fact that such awful designs exist almost makes me want to stop wearing leggings. *Almost.*	11
It looks like it's outdoors in the snow, so you'd be wearing gloves anyway.	27
Honestly I thought it just meant any game where you couldn't choose Casual mode... which is everything pre-Awakening.	27

From one of his posts: “You and I both know full well that multiculturalism isn’t working, and that [NAME] need to go home.”	27

Chills. I can’t wait. I’m sure [NAME] will get over this not being happy because they have bigger fish to fry.	10

We love him, duh. He's our NT captain and our ace.	18
Mississippi, where your sibling is your first lover.	27

Given [NAME] was in charge of the transition I don't see how he kept his hands clean. I think if [NAME] goes down so does he.	27
It's still not something I'd jump to and I'm currently in a closed relationship really.	27
It’s always entertaining watching people in the background semi-dance, while being painfully aware that they’re on camera	17
The myth is about selling shirts. Signing [NAME] opens up much more money making opportunities like commercials.	20
My bad on the terminology, see my response above for some of my thoughts / concerns related to the presence of 2-chlorophenol	27
leg-lock speaks to me in the most animalistic level	27
Armenian elves are known for their thick skin and mouth-breathing. This one seems stoned, I’d stay away from it.	27
Personally I'm wondering why our OP didn't go with the clone angle. That's way more insane than them just being sent to prison.	26
Same company probably makes bacon for Walmart and Kroger. Im guessing they're not the only ones	27
It's a great time to be Scottish anaw	0
I hope the final piece is [NAME] face in the background looking at the entire group with utter contempt.	20
He hasn't stopped clapping ever since	27

WE WERE WINNING UNTIL I STARTED WATCHING, I AM CURSED!	27
if you hate pedos then check out	27
Lol. Thanks for the info	15
My [NAME]... This makes it so much more cringe.	14
Zoos are the reason why many endangered species are no longer endangered. You oppose the existence of zoos. Therefore you would rather see those animals go extinct.	27
They are elected to represent Scotland	27
I’m curious about the chain of life events and choices that could land someone at this point in life	7
Everything in here I want but all we can do is pray to [NAME] for our wishes to come true	27
Unhhh has not been funny for a while now. This is definitely a terrible idea.	11
Thanks. I needed this reminder today.	15
Do you have arthritis yet? To me it seems my arm wouldve fallen off doing this.	27
Tech hobbyist scifi fan (me): That fridge is going to get hacked	27
Are they bigger than our defensive breakdowns and [NAME] five hole?	7

The longer you look at this picture the less satisfying it gets	27
Or, do you organize when you're mind feels more structured? The old chicken or the egg question. 	27
Keep watching!	27
I would assume most people don't listen to the radio for more than an hour at a time.	27
Why are you taking a picture of a playground? Lol	1
Clearly it's all the Big Pharma in the Monsanto™. I heard at least two of those kids had three Monsantos™, EACH! 	27

I like the reference to the Good Place :)	18
Oh, he isn't dead, [NAME] 	26
The guy next to him's reaction face is classic.	4
Hey, I made it in the screenshot!	27
Oh, hey what's up dude? Haven't seen you around in a while bro. Glad to see your still here.	17
St. Anger and All Nightmare Long are my favorite albums :))	27

Apparently Faux news held off on reporting the story at first, presumably until they could get approval on how they should spin it.	27
I like to think it rhymes with wasabi but I have no idea	27

Thank you. Ignore the morons who have never heard of lactose intolerance.	15
Wow [NAME] has a lot more insecurities than I thought	26
"he can still be heard uttering ""I'm a huge fan"" alone in a dark room"	27

Poor kitty! I’m sure she’ll feel okay again soon. Lots of TLC in order	5
[NAME] should be sticking that to the other side of the keeper, strange decision to go for that corner	10
They must've been inside a tornado or something, might be what caused the tree to fall behind them.	27
I love that both replies to you are correct. It can be hard to tell cars apart. But also she probably wasn't paying attention.	18
I never said they were emotionless	10
And let me guess, is our friend [NAME] also shilling his own coin that solves all the problems?	7
do you even need to ask of course we need to support her if we dont who the hell will?	27
Last update was a bit glitchy.	27
If he’s American...then he’s fucked	27
Downvoting because of a lack of funny, regardless of your clumsy attempt to insinuate that my doing so means I'm thin skinned.	27

This was literally me!	26
It’s not even bad	4
I enjoy fixing problems. I think of it as a task that I can achieve. People get to overworked when they set too unreachable goals.	17
I don't think any [RELIGION] woman would care about such a thing. If they did then they have their own problems.	10
So now we have [NAME] King and The Prince. Nice. I'm not even mad with this transfer lol	1
this is my dream	8
Thank you so much for all this! Nobody else seemed to understand the situation and just tell me to eat better, which I already do.	15

you are not capable of disputing self-evident facts.	10
This helped me put together some of my thoughts after watching last night, especially how vanilla and ineffective [NAME] looked. Thanks for taking the time to write this out	15
"""you can't arrest me!! I'm attractive!"""	21
I am always hungry. I do not know fullness. No matter how much I eat.	6

[NAME] always makes my day when he's yelling at the refs	17
They absolutely dont know what love is.	10

> modern art Modern art lasted from 1860 at the earliest to 1970 at the latest. Thanks for your art critique though, it was very informative.	15
It's satirical but also almost truth. We're the fattest nation in Western Europe and that percentage is growing.	27
yes, agreed. 	4
Okay, so the wording didn't matter because she was already too into you. Still nice, thanks. 	15

Thank you. I think I may know that already, but I might need to hear it from others at times when I miss him a lot. 	15
Bad execution but it made me smile through the cringe. The sentiment is definitely relatable.	4
A comb that combs near and far. Great for rushed carpools to work.	27
Bohemian Rhapsody is a horrible song. Really horrible. Queen had a lot of great songs, but that one wasn't one of them.	11

This is a real funny joke, [NAME].	17
I’m okay with the “expecting mother’s” spots. It’s not a women thing, it’s a courtesy thing 	27
Is calling bullshit allowed in this sub? Cause theres no way this happened as [NAME] described. People don't speak like that, even crazy ones. 	7
Get the hell out of here with that fiscal sensibility and care for other human beings!	2
Depends, do you become so old and senile that you have dementia can’t walk and shit	27

It would actually make me more comfortable if someone did that to me	4
Are we talking about [NAME] or [NAME]?	6
nope, this is just older people not understanding how teens actually communicate	10
Btw I’m totally including myself in the karmahungry section but that pic was just too appropriate to not share	4
Because they want to. Why do you act like a goddamn weirdo about stuff like this?	2
Actually looks really fucking fun. Where can I do this?	1
What an incel	27
It's been over a decade since consoles decided to mandate wireless controllers and I'm still annoyed by it.	3
It's disturbing that you even have to ask that.	3
Going to bed early never works for me. Sleeping in is the only way I feel rested.	23
The Pants by [NAME]. Give it a listen. Lol	27
There is this story of a woman who got pregnant from anal due to some rare condition:	27
I've agreed with this since day one. Check out his match he he had with [NAME] back in NXT	4
He didn't blow anything. She blew it with him. What a fun guy!	1
Mind if I use your allegory in my classes? It's perfect.	0
All they see is EA bad, this whole sub is coming full circle jerk now.	10
[NAME]. I still want her to come back to be a [NAME] ally and fight with [NAME].	27
OK, I'll be glad to help you with your trip! 	17
Happy new year!	13
Hot bath helps me, or just heating pad on my breasts. Looks awkward, but it helps. 	4
37 and together 12 years. 11 yo kiddo. Thanks for the tip. You're right.	15
I'll add to this: be prepared to not get closure or questions answered. This is the hardest lesson I had with my break up.	22
He's not wrong though.	4
When I was maybe 8 I discovered that I liked hot dog buns with just ketchup. I shortly discovered what heartburn was.	22
Oh it is, it's just that you know that thing...about the intel	27

[NAME], I love hearing them click in the water. The sound of a healthy ecosystem.	18
You legitimately sound like a hipster.	27
[NAME] is a nut; he has a rubber butt!	27
i find it a little disgusting if swear words are used frequently and unironically.	11
You're saying it's depressing to see someone eating whilst other people are starving.	9
Matinee games always scare me, but I have confidence in this team. LGI!	14
So no resignation or impeachment. Bummer. Naive me had high hopes the great [NAME] wouldn't escape the noose this time.	20
Educate yourself instead of defining yourself.	27
Very insightful and tragic post, OP. Thank you for sharing and raising awareness as someone who has been through the trenches.	15
I love how they all state the stupidity in the quote and the person saying it, with only a few realizing it's something [NAME] said.	18
Like many TIFU posts, I don't believe this one.	10
Not related to any of this but I love your tag next to your username xD	18
You still haven't shown any evidence of racism outside your own mind.	27
Extremely relatable.	4

Thanks [NAME]!	15
Yeah, great!	0
I was scared for that white building.	14
[NAME] stop thinking too much and just do stuff like that	27

Tbh the floor is probably more comfortable than the seats. Doesn't make it safe though.	4
This is a great photoshop! On a related note... retire [NAME] Number and Maybe [NAME] number..... oh and also fire Garpax	0
I think I could watch an entire show with just these two all the time.	4
They're basically our version of [NAME] and [NAME] at this point. Every video seems to involve a dumbass rant that misses the point of the topic.	27
As a strip club connoisseur, this is one of my biggest fears. 	14
I’ve actually been there lol	1
You're way too involved in this. Take a break from the internet.	27

ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN!	27
Hm so sad. Am I supposed to feel bad for you because you don't look like [NAME] phelps? Btw, he's on steroids no doubt	25
Margin of error: 0.7%	27
Let me admit. This show is a guilty pleasure. Seeing these people's lives in such chaos brings me joy.	17
If they overdo it and burn themself out it may be.	27
If this was some weird publicity stunt to announce the [NAME] is coming back I will die. In reality, it makes me think he's coming back	3
As far as I know, the last necromancer you kill is guaranteed to drop a lantern.	27
She might die before then, risky move either way.	27
Those eyebrows are faker than my future	3

Cue [NAME] and his rant on old American men	27
Haha you have a cut on your face you must be the worst person who ever lived.	1
That is the issue with most things, if you work there you can not win, as well as friends and family members.	10
Highly reccomend it OP Listen i got 74 days cigerette free i couldnt be happier! My next step is quitting the juul which is gonna be rough	4

Poetic justice they get to the title game host Philly and BDN whips it out for them and shoves it down their throat. That would be epic.	27
You're not wrong. We move better in a chaotic atmosphere rather than a structured one.	4

Literally a post on reddit by a woman being creepily hit on by a neighbor, with his wife's permission. Today.	27
oof I hope he didn't break his arms landing like that	20
I’d love it if the Star Wars license was revoked from EA and then Obsidian make another KOTOR game.	18
I tried. [NAME] responded by taking the baby to see her without me, while I was at work. 😤	27
I'm concerned because I understood it as well. Is Kykko a bot?	5
Shocking that a fat DnD kid is this self-important. Remarkable.	26
Bjj= Brazilian jujitsu, they are known to have stupid think necks due to constantly being grabbed around the neck while grappling.	27
I'll wait until he enforces this before I get excited.	13
Sometimes I wish he read mine	8
Nah I’m donating it	27
Man that sure is one fun kid. He's more fun here than I'll ever be my whole life 😞	27
A world where I despise a good number of republicans AND democrats.	10
I lowkey love the chicken and waffles from longhorn chicken. It’s a food truck in west campus.	18
[NAME] from Always Sunny is literally the best comparison for this dude. He looked a LOT like him and behaved the same way.	27
I’m so happy [NAME] gets to make more money	17
I’m not going to get in to the boring details here, but... Too late.	27
Is this real? 🤔	7
"Anarchist to cop: ""Stop beating people!"" Cop: ""Stop imposing your morality on me, you lifestylist!"""	27
I'm surprised [NAME] let her post that.	26
Whaaaat no way, you can’t play it with other people? 	2
Thank you :)	15
Anybody who likes to drink water with ice is a degenerate	27
Wow thanks I would've never figured out that you were sarcastic without that /s	15
...*rip everyone who didnt go to college and instead paid your way through a degree which is hopefully a net return*	20
I confirm, my increased by around 20% every year for the last 3 years.	4
Was it a quad-core or a six-core? I always find my Apple easier to eat if I turn it off first.	27
Idk, I'd say the screams of government pawns dying is a pretty cool sound effect.	0
John Oliver is a fucking liberal pig.	2
I believe you. Have you compared them to any other designs of headphones in the same price range though?	27
It's such a lol watching them trying to desperately rationalise their literalism.	1
Maybe had a bad experience with [NAME]? But [NAME] and [NAME] still seemed like good friends what with [NAME] visiting the Solo set...	6
Made me cry and my one year old golden who was laying near my feet ended up coming up and snuggling me.	18
Wow, that's cool!	26
haha love it!	18
Happens to me sometimes too in certain scenarios. Its frustrating especially when you're banking on it deflecting something.	3
Wow. How many beds is 22 wards?	0
Rec and Red just need to die as teams. Fucking joke of a performance here considering how much funding they are both getting.	3
Man that was like 6 minutes ago	27
Omg I think I laughed way harder at this than I should have!! 🤣💍	1
Those guys are on top 5 Levels.	27
Counterpoint, ACAB.	27
You might not be eating enough. You almost have to double. 2000 calories of meat vs 2000 calories of veggies is a HUGR difference.	5
So are leftists ones. You will get banned for disagreeing with someone REEEEing at trump.	10
thanks, it’s been so much better	15
No it’s true. However it is time to rethink how we recycle clothing in cities and the elimination of donation bins is step one.	10
lool chill fam, u aint gotta do him that bad	1
I saw that, and read it *immediately* in his voice.	27
That looks like you need to go to the hospital ASAP or you'll lose a limb and possibly more.	5
CHONK. WANT. FLUFFY.	27
Excuse me?	7
What state and what size of city? Im curious if it's inner city of small town	7
Roids are a lot more harmful than makeup.	22
If you don't believe the government has the power to restrict things, you're not a liberal, you're an anarchist or a libertarian.	27
Did your finger go completely sloppy? Thats grossly awesome.	0
Oh no you didn’t just quote tlc...👍🏼	10
I would love a gatling gun arm like Barret from FF7 has.	18
37?? He looks 47. Hard life...drugs and alcohol.	6
I dont really know, I think its mostly because they just get these really high end computers and do nothing with them.	10
It's funny because he just got out of jail.	1
Ya did good, bud.	0
I still defend the evening gown .. that purple and that wig were right	4
The third floor isn't high enough. I'm also in dire need of a job and the stress is unreal.	27
Totally irrelevant to my point	10
Daddies little nightmare	27
Lmao I wonder how much effort it takes to reread 2 lines that she deemed too straining. What an era to live in...	1
California Adventure has beer so I'm fuckin living the dream.	13
Thanks for the help!	15
Oh. My. [NAME].	27
BUT IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN THEM LIKE TWO SECONDS TO HELP HIM GET OUT REALLY!!! This show makes me angry sometimes.	2
Thanks for the tip! I just watched it and now I want more insider info!	15
That was it! Thank you	15
Just commenting here to give you a notification :) Have a nice day now	4
[NAME]. I’m not sure you’ll feel the same way when it hurts to open doors when you’re 35.	6
I just hope [NAME] gets hired	20
Well then, I can't wait for you to prove me wrong but your throwaway comment isn't helpful.	27
Yeah, my thoughts exactly. Alright people, time to revive this comrade's karma.	27
Daddy Patches!	27
Yes!!! It shows insecurity... automatically swipe left	27
ahhhhh ok I thought it was the other way round, thanks for clearing it up.	15
[NAME] also hates selfies	27
I love how you're making an assumption to try and make a point.	18
The film room crew think he'd be first qb, but top drafters don't need qb	27
I bet he doesn’t line up for Daniels Donuts	27
I know! I love it..... this is who we really are!	18
Made by [NAME] who also was involved with Sacred Games so I think you'll enjoy it.	17
Yeah it wasnt like we had girlfriends	27
That'll cost ya.	27
Bless your heart sweaty. Bless your heart.	5
Women cheat way more. They have unlimited options like a kid in a candy store. Most men couldn't cheat if they tried	27
I really wish this wonderful person would run for president! <3	20
The guys rappelling on the wall... Wow.	0
No!!! I love emojis 😎😎😁😁😁😁💖🎉	18
That’s what I’m terrified of.	14
You will never have as many girls interested in you as when you have a girlfriend. They can smell it	3
Glasses and [NAME] made me regain interest in the show. Pluuus I want to know what happens to [NAME], she's my favourite character :(	7
I personally believe [NAME] is asexual, other characters in simillar situations all get hints toward homosexuality but I can't remember any for [NAME].	4
It's not my cousin's fault. It was actually me who set up the whole date.	27
and he's fat from all those luxury meals	27
You're with him, you brought him here to kill me.	22
Wow she sounds like fun	1
I haven't seen him in a few days now, and his car hasn't been there so I've been going outside more.	27
Damnit! What song is that at the end!?!	7
Couldn't agree more.	10
You are terrible developers.	3
Must be so frustrating having the wrong old man facing their own shutdowns.	2
Don’t be saucy with me, mister! I ain’t Alfredo you! 	27
Well if they are in the playoffs it likely means we are not so that should be a cause for concern regardless of how they perform once they get there	27
I literally received the ready up bug while playing solo yesterday.	27
It's fascinating how each language originated isn't it but the how it happened is beyond my scope.So I don't dwell much upon it.	27
[NAME] was not a candidate in the presidential election.	27
That doesn't look too bad.	4
It's an absurdly racist phrase that these anti-racist activists are very comfortable using for some reason.	27
[NAME]. Forever	27
Did [NAME] funnel money to any paramilitaries?	27
Can't tell if sarcasm, or an irrelevant statement, but thanks, first thing to see venturing into reddit at 00:15, actually nice :o	15
[NAME] was almost all around higher rated going into the draft Hindsight is 20/20	27
Hahahaha. This. This right here. 😂	1
We are there right now. 🍺	4
This guy looks like the real life [NAME]	0
Too bad it's only good enough to fool dumb animals or animals with poor eyesight	27
Well with how often the VPD turns a blind eye downtown I promise you vigilante justice is coming.	27
Trust your gut	20
There are courts. You need to document all this and let the judge give him a tongue lashing. Not that that would make a difference...	27
Here's a real example.	4
Nail in the coffin. Sucks that refs always feel the need to call an equalizer penalty	27
Right. Lol Then they try to gaslight the audience. As if we cant pause and rewind.	1
That depends on the country and the state (if in the US.) You don't even know what continent they're on.	27
WHAT A SHIFT!!! Can't stop that zone.	6
Wanting America to be better does not mean hating America. We can do better than [NAME]. He’s an embarrassment to the entire country.	12
You thought wrong. Also, the answer is Caribbean Splash Car Wash on Clarksville Pike. I'm not even kidding.	10
No. Utterly despicable cult with no redeeming value.	27
Oh my [NAME] coco I’m so sorry sweety	24
I'm getting politically charged rhetoric from a cola company now?	7
Been living in US for 4 months. Saying obesity is out of hand would be an understatement.	27
He was also involved in a much less known NBC investigation into	4
It's not as if she was my supervisor at bestbuy lol.	1
Well I’m hyped.	13
I like how nobody else is doing anything to stop him	18
He does hate [NAME] though. And [NAME] gets promoted.	27
Hmmm.. This map]( a lot like this map	27
You armchair analysed it, and were entirely wrong. Literally none of what you said was true, because it was all pretend. 	3
👍 <3<3 so much yes! 🔥	4
Yeah it's unexpected but I have to remove this because it's not satire or gatekeeping.	3
But she still looking like late twenties	27
Hey, you can make baseless claims if you want. Don’t expect people to just believe you though.	10
The air can kill you at this temperature.	27
I was pointing out the irony of [NAME] comment.	27
Miz Cracker is the worst parts of Aquaria and Trixie. Unprofessional pettiness and shadiness of Aquaria and the slightly problematic and sometimes delusional humor of Trixie.	27
Ugh I wish!!! You’re not in the US?	8
We'll worry about it tomorrow	27
yep he joined the wrong org	27
> People who aren’t stupid don’t get offended when Called stupid. Exactly. Well put. Thanks.	15
The thought of him having to schedule me in really turns me off and makes me sad. Has the reduced gaming time helped with intimacy in any way?	25
I don’t think there’s anything sad about how many people are attending from their country, but I am doubtful of their prospects!	6
what are you doing here, [NAME]	7
The best champagne	0
A life well spent....	27
Man, I wish Fed was still 26 for these matches lol 	1
Haha I was about to say damn she straight up eviscerated her in between bites.	1
Crazy how [NAME] being a POS had been factual since the 90s but he’s only now feeling the consequences of his actions	26
Eh, you can't really judge his character solely on the appearances he makes on his GF's IG without making a ton of presumptions	3
What fun is this?? I love it!	18
yes they do, and I am glad that you were able to change hers. 	17
You go home now	27
*sees title* hello there!	27
All i want is to be able to grab pig from an island and let it run freely on my deck	4
Welcome to MTV Cribs! The whole place is a giant bed for me	27
It was still controversial at the time which was my point.	27

Thank you sound engineer for confirming that LOUD NOISE = FUNNY /s of course... thank you for your service.	15

That canopy looks like it could take someones head off.	27
Good, I was hoping I wasn't putting false words in your mouth.	20
Ahh, that's why I love my country. 	18
I was surprised the general public hadn't already heard of them tbh. They have been around for quiet sometime.	26
I’ve been there and it’s above a highway, feel like that might raise some eyebrows haha	1
We all are afraid of losing our jobs here or being blackballed all the same.	14
Daaang [NAME] lost weight!!!! Is she making a comeback?	7
Thank you!!!!!	15
I SAW THIS ORION IN HALF, AND WITH THE POWER OF SPEAR SPAM,,,,, :DDD	27
Oh my goodness.....I'm sorry. It's probably gonna take a long time to cope it.....	24
Give me liberty or give me death metal	27
Then believe me...he Always will be looking. It’s just the way it is with some guys.	27
Thanks for the hug matey :)	15
Happy Cake Day [NAME]! Use what talents you possess: the woods would be very silent if no birds sang there except those that sang best.	17
What a weird character to use for something like this	3
wow. how arrogant of him /s	3
He did all this road to find this coconut oil ! Are you ungrateful ? :( !	6
I have a very confused boner rn	6
why is this guy assuming the teen is some kind of southern pro slavery hick	6
The butcher seems to bug out, and not pay you, after around 3 horseback pelts, anyway.	27
Well it depends on your level, class, and how good you roll.	4
What are they doing up there?	27
> **most government positions**, especially elected positions **don't have any education or skill requirements** FWIW Yea they do.	9
... ...I’ll get back to you.	27
I drew that Godzilla!!! I'm OPs friend btw.	27
If you don't think MAGA hats are associated with racism then you've got your head stuck in the sand.	27
They did this at one of my jobs. The icing on the 'fuck you cake' was the drivers' last day was 4 days before Christmas.	3
Remember they are an ex for a reason. Seeing that smile probably made you remember all the happy times	4
12. He gets beat up by a total LOSER by the name of [NAME].	27
This is the truest statement I’ve ever read about [NAME]. May he smile mercifully upon you.	4
is a minimum score. If you don't get it you fail the ASVAB. It's a really simple concept.	4
The only part of church I'm sad my kids will miss.	25
"""[NAME]!"" *screeched the two apprentices as they tried to prove their worth to the the one who shall not be named*"	27
I seen reactions to this elsewhere and DAM famales are some sensitive fucers, you see something online and your whole life fall apart like 🙂🖥️😢😭😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭	27
Right, that makes sense! I wonder if the person I met in real life would acknowledge he's more of a fence sitter than childfree, haha	26
Go on Webtoons and look up Boo! It's sex. Great freaking sex ed comic.	0
Fuck a TD. I just want to survive [NAME].	2
starting a new trend lol	1
The ones who agree with her are the only ones who actually address *her* issue....which is how to deal with boundary stomping relatives.	4
It's pretty much a new format now, it must have been TF2 centred. 	27
just doesnt make sense... almost 30, already played in La Liga and they likely could have had him at any time he was there.	27
I like this idea.	4
I’m just doing it ironically to own the libs! /s	27
Be prepared for a child support order. But my dad just decided he didn't want to pay any more and the CSEA was ok with that.	27
I am just utterly disgusted by it all	11
"I think it's hilarious you guys think this will ""help"" [NAME] Yeah [NAME] was bad, but [NAME] didn't show very much either"	1
I apologise for coming off as rude, the end comment was unnecessary and needlessly rude	2
For fuck sake... just go and remind them it's the quiet train!	3
The old “I had sex with your mom” joke. I chuckled a little.	1
What a good pupper	0
Hope [NAME] is watching this but he's probably too busy snorting some lines	20
It was a joke long before the meme haha	1
I stand corrected! But, if that's the case, who is the world's second most famous groundhog (assuming [NAME] remains #1)?	4
We don't. That is exclusively a leftist thing, and you know it. 	10
Wow, thanks! Now i am rich again!	15
these have to be probably the worst presses ive ever seen, sorry mate	24
27 too many	27
This dish is a testament to be beautify and ingenuity of Italian civilization and culture.	0
I reallllly loved the show. It disturbed me a lot, definitely. But I want more now.	18
Instead of dumped underground at a later date, just dumped into the sea earlier. Despicable	27
Even then, the commentor could have gotten the joke and was just being dead pan. 	1
Damn how do you post something directly to the front page?	2
Thanks, I sort of bought myself the leadership role with that little stunt I pulled. I will do my best. 	15
He's active tonight	27
My #1	27
Sorrow. Sorrow.	27
Wholesome encounters like this what keeps my hopes up for red dead online tbh	27
2 warm days and we all lose our minds? :)	27
Hope you get “at are it again”	20
It's the end of the world as we know it...and I feel fine	4
I hate Detroit	2
Congratulations on the job interview! NParents seem to give the absolute *worst* job advice. I'm glad that you've figured that out earlier than I did!	0
Imagine [NAME] ever saying this.	27
Pretty sure it’s a reference to Netflix’s “Bird Box” movie. In which case - brutal; I love it.	18
Im actually going to this game! One of the only chances every year I have to see the boys play in person. LET GO DEVILS	13
Over thinking things on both sides.	27
Give her weed to make her asexual and want to have sex with you. Great [NAME] logic.	0
That is odd.	11
There were a surprising amount of surprised pikachus in this thread—thanks for the edit all the same.	26
This is actually so funny, this is something id expect from Australian sports media since we're shit at broadcasting but lmao	1
The stigma is justified. I dont care how you got it, it's still disgusting.	11
In whom? There are millions of people walking around today with no problems.	27
This is the most Chicago music video I think I’ve ever seen and I love it. Classic song!	0
I don't believe no one in your class thought of Mac or iPhone.	27
I feel like the last two seasons made me detach from the show.	9
I really hope not. Personally I have no interest in VR games, and not even my favorite game would change that.	20
He should really let [NAME] come inside him	27
Its probably just related to something she is dealing with. Stress/anxiety often causes nightmares. But there are plenty of potential	5
Lol Yes Most people arent 100% either (especially women). For a variety of reasons...finding beauty in other people, curiosity, jealousy, etc...	1
I prefer to pay for my hugs, higher quality.	27
Which is exactly the point capt obvious.	27
I've seen guys who didn't know each other start conversations about sports. It all seemed very effortless.	9
Well I mean Australia is a good example of this working isn’t it ?	4
That sex doesn't exist and we're all just pretending for his benefit...	10
I like you. No promo	18
No, that's not possible. If you have proof then it's not misinformation what your spreading but simply information. 	10
I’m very happy for you! Congrats! 😁	17
I think there is a reality to that. Some of the focus has shifted to policing the language at the expense of dealing with more fundamental issues.	4
Now you move onto personal insults. Well done O king of the waffles. Once again using a word (nuance) with no context. Bored now.	3
Try to get between us and our maple syrup and see what happens	27
His wife wears a burka too, lest her comely appearance detracts him from godly thoughts.	27

Lol my comment started all this again	1
Thanks for the input! I definitely want to check that out it looks beautiful Do you think a puffer jacket is necessary?	15
This!!!	27
Yeah, because it’s soooo arduous to look at someone’s profile for five seconds. 	4
He absolutely loves it!!	18
If she stole a wallet with an activated card, or something along those lines. Once it's purchased, it's stealable.	27
Any good reading on [NAME]? I don't really know if I like her or not.	6
Not any meaningful amount as far as I can tell. Although I’d love to be surprised	10
I agree...I just tell them the card is declined. It happens to everyone	4
ya keep pretending you can tell people what to do... see how that works out for you	27
Are you able to see a therapist or counselor?	7
That's your justification? You're a terrible person. Correction: You're a terrible child. Get some help.	14
Wait theres rats!!!??? Im calling health and safty!	27
#THANK YOU FOR THE RED ARROWS. I NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED IT WAS THE TOP COMMENT	15
He had doubts but no matter, the baby changed his life and he wouldn't abandon it no matter what :)!	5
Getting the second one out of the way as well 🙄	27
[NAME] - Holdin on. Check out his music because he is honestly amazing.	0
Get more crushes.	27
It sounds like he doesn't know exactly what he wants and he's taking it out on you.	27
Pleasure to meet you brother	15
OwO what's this?	7
Yes!!!	27
I have secondhand embarrassment for them both.	12
Das pretty sweet. No-look throw!	0
I knew her in high school- she's awesome!	0
It’s just speculation, but...yikes!	27
You care more about their actions in that case.	5
That's what I was going for, but I felt like replying with /r/woooosh was too much of a cookie cutter response. 	27
I agree you need to plan ahead. But you can't build infrastructure that will be heavily under-utilised and drive you broke to make.	4
After 3 weeks of vacation, today is my final vacation day. Unfortunately, I go back to work tomorrow. not staying up for this one	27
Can we stop suggesting [NAME] as [NAME] it's not happening.	10
This website is so strange.	27
"Also in response to /u/hyunL. There was. Among other things such as vocally wanting rape to be legalized, ""breeding"" farms, among other things. "	27
I’m intrigued.	7
TELL TELL TELL. [NAME] I wish someone had told me.	8
No worries. Just didn't see them. My bad.	9
It was more of a joke. I still have hope for [NAME]. Just kind of a tough sell at this point.	20
That look is exactly like my Waffle House. And the one past that and a town over.	4
Honestly wish [NAME] would just stop taking threes all together. They just don’t fall for him.	8
You said you will turn 16 next year, this summer isnt next year	10
Honestly it makes me sad but [NAME] does need less time:/	25
[NAME], if you're doing an Undertale deal, not having a red heart on your ass is inexcusable.	10
Is that meat or veggies?	27
The fact that [NAME], the other principal in the original story, has gotten out of this unscathed is annoying.	3
AP can tell them to leave, and then call the cops if they don't. Soliciting/begging is not allowed on Target property. 	10
Where is the problem? **Just do it again!**	27
Well good luck and have fun!	17
OMG! I can only imagine. I've gotten it into a hang nail before and that was NOT fun.	26
Of course he does lol. Not very often, but he definitely has to block from time to time. 	1
I don’t even like basketball that much. Chill out man	10
Teen spirit sure ain't what it used to be...	10
Just cut your losses, get out and don't look back!	5
Though underwear would have made this less embarrassing, I wear it for a different reason. 	12
That's what I thought too man	27
That might be an issue when it comes to meeting girls all the way around. Generally we love a guy who can make us laugh.	18
I'm surprised he hasn't already. He was charged on Dec. 31st but his name was only released yesterday.	26
$20 paywall out $20 'starter pack' in — this would be great	0
No, because vaccines are recommended worldwide. And also, not amputating a body part.	10
Looks wise you sound dateable but no, I wouldn't date you, because you seem to have an overemphasis on appearance	10
/r/keto too believe it or not.	6
Looks like he drops the chainsaw right as the branch hits him	27
I'm sure it was Leyou, the Chinese chicken farm company, that had shares, and not Tencent.	27
Nope. This is shown with [NAME] spider-man having reversed version of the Raimiverse spider-man, a la the upside down kiss having [NAME] on the bottom instead.	27
I am vuri disappointed in you. You gained turdy pounds tis munt. Scale dont lie	9
Give it time people will figure out the truth if you engage with her then that gives her what she wants. She will definitely use that against you.	5
Why is [NAME] out? Is it a rest thing or a minor injury?	7
Whatever you do, don’t try to use a bone to get it out. It’ll only make it worse.	27
When bear attacks kick him I'm the ball!	27
Takeover was great but the spectacle of the rumble match itself makes it more interesting for me. Same with MITB and elimination chamber.	0
I see him doing that.	4
I'm 39 and still love being given chocolate.	18
Women have a right to their own bodies. Your comments are horribly patronizing. They indicate that women intellectually develop slower than men which is sexist.	4
Sorry to hear that, I have it for ps4 and hardcore dlc servers are still up	25
No, but it can cost more than the minimum wage.	22
Funny you say that... krav maga is quite popular in Evanston.	1
The ghost of [NAME] saves the day!	27
That guy talked bad about his haircut I guess	6
Especially when it's right in your FACE	27
Just think of it as set in an alternate universe where America didn’t just take independence but went back to England and established their own colonies there.	27
Could be an attainability thing. My personality is very aloof and I tend to have much better results with more confident girls in general.	20
yes i did, thanks for explaining	15
What rights do men have that women don't in the west? Damn.	3
I support abortion	27
I'd let him destroy me with facts and knowledge 😩😩😩	27
It's been with me all day. Those reams of entries is one of the most quietly horrific things I've ever seen.	11
I have faith	27
It surprises me that he's a mod some days...	26
That sucks! Your lady giblets are NONE of her damn business. Does your BF at least try to curb her mouth?	3
Someone somewhere wants to be cuddled too. You'll never find that person if you don't talk to anyone you want to cuddle with.	5
Austin Powers that shit	27
Yes to momentum. The time spent between phases is important. It’s also bad matchmaking	4
Fuck yeah! Bring on 2019	27
Mine do honestly, but I try not to use mine much when I’m in public with people because that’s tacky.	27
Ah yes, resort to ad-hominem attacks when you have nothing else to say.	27
Dude, I can't express in words how much relief this man brings to my soul.	23
I dated a guy from Steamboat Springs Colorado who used to do this. He had an immune system made of steel but it was absolutely disgusting.	11

did anyone calculate aprox. how much would the food cost in total?	27
[NAME], aside from the goal was several magnitudes worse than [NAME]....	27
He looks 10 years younger since leaving Old Trafford.	4

I guess Metric is old enough now for one of their songs to be Grey’s title. Huh.	27
Goobi is love.	18
[NAME] might've told her when they were talking about [NAME] being on her period.	27
I wish [NAME] would debate [NAME], if he was alive :(. 	8
Yeah that's bullshit and the complete opposite of what you said.	2
That's [NAME]!	4
Good thing there’s someone sensible in the Whitehouse.	27
That is one big pile of cringe.	27
Lol, and be sure to slam the door real hard when you leave.	27
That is not a side swipe. That's a full on t-bone. But I hope they all made it through somehow.	8
Chugging hot sauce is for retards, not for serious chefs.	27
These are the kinds of dudes that gillette ad is talking about.	27
I’m afraid too. It’s the not knowing what will happen that scares me.	14
I’m still not sure how we managed to do that. Gas prices in this state has gone up around 70 cents per gallon since around 2013	6
Happy birthday u/automoderator	27
Someone somewhere decided that today is the day they're tired of their job. We've all been there.	27

So air doesn't move if your hand isn't faster then speed? I doubt that.	27
So you are an expert on the 5 year long climate patterns going back billions of years i take it.	4
Thanks for the contribution. Really enlightening.	15
[NAME], I hate [NAME].	2
Eastside Cafe was pretty pricey for what it was.	10
Rule 7: Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient)	27

They barely screen apparently, and it's ok, I know I'm garbage lol	1

I wish they had what they advertised. The end of that era was sometime in my teens.	20
Funny how the [NAME] leaves the most important item out of their article headline.	1
Players salaries are going up drastically every year. They’re hardly getting squeezed.	10
“Game 7” Unfortunately we’ll never get there.	9
Immaturity at its finest	27
Lol, crazy move of the goalpost but okay	1
Exactly, thank you. 	15
That's probably percisely what they did... They couldn't get into the server still. I'm sure they have specific rules about delaying and pausing.	27
MORE OF THAT PLEASE NORMAN!!!	27
I'd rather we didn't discuss this kind of stuff here, really. Doesn't feel very useful to any kind of debate. 	10
You need to clasp your hands on top of a book to get rid of depression? Thanks grandma	15
I didn’t think of that, thank you!	15

You're right, I was just trying to avoid getting too specific, as all financial advise will vary based on OP's financial situation and needs.	4
"From the article ""They stun it, and then he knifed it."" Not sure which doese the kill though."	6
It’s supposed to be. But ol [NAME] snuffed a few out that he could have otherwise put clothes on and sent home.	27
I have no idea what arbitration even is but I'm going to react poorly	6
Yea, and trading away young players does not make us better.	27
he always pays his debts but we'll have to wait to see if [NAME] gets a castle	27
The [NAME] excuse needs to die. [NAME] was on the bench for an extended period when the Raps defence made [NAME] freaking [NAME] look like an all-star.	27
Sold car almost two years ago.... no regrets and quality of life has actually improved.	4
I love your comment...	18
This looks like [NAME] at the gym	27
Gotcha. That can happen sometimes too but make sure you follow up with your gyno just incase.	5
Trae getting where he wants whenever he wants, that’s all that matters	27
[NAME] earned it I think. He was godlike at world's. But [NAME] is the absolute worst S+ on this list.	6
Thanks, just bought this!	15
Louth is just an auld patch of muddy water you wade through to get from Belfast to Dublin.	27
Juul is heavy vapor. Idk how to describe it but i didnt feel like that when i used other juices	6

[NAME] was born that way, huh	27
What are you gonna do when your 150 years old and a giant angry bird won't stop trying to kill you?	27
Seems kind of literal	27
Oh [NAME], my new friend. How much time and wine do you have.	7
Doubt Bucks would ever let hm go though	27

It does indeed. 😏	20
Ok. This is freaking awesome! Good job.	0

I think he actually isn't feeling well tonight. He left practice early yesterday because he felt light headed, [NAME] still put him in.	27
"""A lot can change in 365 days. Hang in there."""	20
Agreed. He always sounded like he was forcing to much air out of his lungs when he talked to try to have a more intimidating voice.	4

Flush the toilet that's a deduction.	27
I love me some buff girls!	18
Because I was with someone who accepts cheating as an acceptable form of behavior.	27

That's where your mind went? Most of us instantly think about Winnie the Pooh and the Hundred Acre Woods, man. What's wrong with you?	7
Everything's broken then. It's not like all other discourse is high minded and unemotional.	9

Change of top, pump, inner tubes, puncture repair kit & tyre levers, balaclava, lube. 	27

You'd have to explain what that means to you first. It's such a nebulous phrase it's never meant much of anything to me.	27
This is a slippery slippery slope that ends with the backstory to the Wrath of Khan dude.	27
Thank you for your kind words! Your energy is contagious!	15

I love me some Cat but someone clearly never read The mists of Avalon	18
Looked ugly.	10
Thanks so much! I'll let you know how it goes when I get a chance to try it :)	15
I honestly don't know but the more attention something gets the less it gets ignored	27
Thank you very much for your time and advice! I’ll consider it greatly for the future!	15
Nohomo but i'd come to daddy	27
Doctors hate him! *Like* if you love **[NAME]**, *Ignore* if you worship the **[NAME]!**	27
I believe they know about it and don’t care, but they aren’t paying someone that doesn’t work there to do it.	3
Yikes!! This rebuild year isn't fun	10
Maybe don't pick something quite so obscure.... But my girl does	6
Real. I did it yesterday when there was a large spider trying to hitchhike in my car	27
It's one of these situations where I'm happy that I'm not enough of a gimp to understand	17
but but TIME IS MONEY right?	27
I got hung up thinking like this for thirty years with my first and only love. Don't let it happen to you.	18
In all fairness Ive said it to men, woman, and children. Nobody is outside of my blind rage.	4
Laughed right out loud 🤣	1
The only thing that changed is we are now healthcare-less	27
No, that’s my husband. 	27
He's the best [NAME].	0
You here to admit you are fine with existence once born? I thot so	7

Please provide some receipts! I believe you and can totally see this happening!	27
Sanctions are immoral and don't do anything but cause more human suffering, disappointing to see that this sub will support them, but not really a shock. 	9
No, my point is that looking to past behaviors isn’t indicative of what is right and virtuous 	10
I got your back, bros. (nsfw, duh) 	27
> but I have to admit its catchy. This is not and has not ever been an inherently positive characteristic about any song.	9
Good assumption there except for the part where I didn't vote for the guy.	0
I wish it'd stop being submitted on the sub. We're out on him and it's pretty obvious.	8

Now figure out how to grow bunches like that.	27
Not defending the poor choice, but maybe he thought this is what they'd like?	27
[NAME] has 5 goals in 4 games for us doesn’t he?	27
Ohhhhh come on [NAME], just two more years...	27
WHAT THE HELL?!?!?!?	2
I'm impressed. A 3 year old account and this is your only comment.	0
Short, succinct, and perfect. It would be nice if the more of the world realized this simplicity of life.	22
Good to know everything is about average there. Leave it to H-Town to hold it down.	17
Who cares honestly.	3
You can’t say that that’s racist!!!!!!	27
Thank you for the thoughtful advice. I was thinking of getting him a mic for his gaming habit, so your advice is timely.	15

SWOOOSH!!	27
Apparently the system is down	27
She looks so pretty in that photo.	0
Have you talked to your group and [NAME] about him?	7
[NAME] but probably secondly, [NAME] because I find both so boring.	11

Not when they are written by his lawyers, but he totally wrote 'build the wall crime will fall' and thought it was so clever	27
Thanks yeah that sounds good	15
I still can't believe I used to watch [NAME] videos	26
These parents probably dress and openly love the kid more	27
Are you saying you did not expect those bananas?	7
Wow, that's clunky.	26
Damn. Hope they don’t have children	8
I'm also scared.	14
There’s no such thing as the trauma Olympics. Try some empathy sometime.	27

I had no idea this was a thing!	27
Blatant manipulation. Wow!! Who do we report that to?	26
>ageism Lol. Nobody's *discriminating against* these folks cuz they're teenagers. Settle it down, mate.	27
Yeah you’re implying that someone holds the shitty opinion you just made up. Which is basically an attempt to make them look bad. Character assassination.	10
I should stop jumping in elevators.	22
It’s okay bro saints about to beat them 41-3 next week lmao don’t worry	5

They're hoping that him being found guilty was the news item that mattered, and they can let him off easy now that the attention has died down.	27
Besides it being hard and fucking up your kettles, irons, hair and taps?	3
Because you didnt add enough context	27
We say it the most m8 that means it's our word and we pronounce it correctly	27

It's impossible for communism to exist without a state.	27
[NAME] fucked up with this line up. Why do you change it, if everything was going good? Idiot! 	2
. . .k but it's unlikely since unless you're a liberal and a woman thinking emotionally often shouldn't be a thing.	25
Some idiot talks shit to one woman - > SOCIETY shames WOMEN for BEING ALIVE	2
Look at his socks, hes fine	27
Fantastic!!	0
That’s the silver lining of this. Fuck Veracruz.	2

I have died so I know something you don’t.	27
Actually I think they were saying on ETR that you have to use it or you lose it for expansion teams	27
This was insane. I knew [NAME] was legit when he swung at a pitch while being intentionally walked and almost hit it out.	26
Pretty stock standard winger. Depth at a good club, regular starter at a bad club kinda deal	26
Great, glad to hear most socialists are hypocrites who ascribe supernatural outcomes to their ideology	0

My heart just melted.	18
We need [NAME] to review this...	27
How can I send it to you? I Just exactly recreated it in training arena	6
Yes, you’re right. Thank you for your kind words.	15
It is possible to be a shitbag and also suffer the unfair competition of organized conglomerates of shitbags. Besides, OP wasn't referring to all independent farmers.	27
Apparently America is 400 years old according to him as well.	27
Don't be mad, life is too short!	27
Yeah, maybe if they add [NAME] and [NAME]...	27
I miss the bch/bsv war...the quality of posts were getting better....back to square 1	9

The power dynamics argument is one of the most ridiculous arguments ever - unless it’s someone who has a *direct* influence on your life or outcomes.	10
[NAME] has lost it and I'm loving it!	18
Much better than I could have put it! Thank you for your input!	15

Because [NAME] is a man child who can’t stand up to his mother	9
Yeah, but the thing is that I did send them. Therefore, I don’t have them, and haven’t for months.	27
Less of “It’s my baby too” and more of “it’s an innocent living being and you want to murder it”.	27
If this team could make there wide open shots, we could win some games. Its unbelievable how many open shots we miss. 	9
Thank you [NAME]. Apparently having a sense of humor isn't your strong suit	15
This seems like something that would be hilarious as a parody	1
Another trendy communist that doesn't know what communism is.	10
