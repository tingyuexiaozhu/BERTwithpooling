Happy to be able to help.	17
Famous for his 3-4 Defense	0
Pretty sure I‚Äôve seen this. He swings away with the harness he is wearing. Still looks painful but I think he lives	25
I wouldn't let a sweet potato dictate decisions, ever.	10
It's true though. He either gets no shirt and freezes to death or wears a stupid looking butchers cape. I hope he gets something better next season	20
You can always kneel.	4
This isn't really wholesome	10
Thanks DB, I'll see if I can find the book	15

You just make her sound awesome.	0

Your team lacks ethics.	10
i wouldn't take that significant of a pay cut. you should keep your job and do your creative writing on the side/free time.	5
Thanks I'll give it a go. Nothing used for randoms at all? Would it be better for me to find a group to play with?	15
I appreciate his deadpan humour.	0
So I said earlier that this team was boring without [NAME] lately. I take that back after the last two games.	22
It's because you play against 1000 ms ping EU players that have no idea what's going on. Happy hunting!	17
The fuck is ‚Äúmog?!‚Äù	2

youre a disgusting piece of filth.	11
Just an employee, just stressed that it takes so long to save 10k for example and even that is nothing ! Should of brought more bitcoins	9

You live in Appalachia, don‚Äôt you?	7
That pole and cheap plastic fence surely would offer excellent protection from a car. Walk it off brah.	4
What the fuck is [NAME] doing in the background	2
It creates perverse incentives. Allow underpaid prison labour and suddenly you've an incentive towards exploiting your prison population rather than rehabilitating them.	3
Yeahhhh no, you're banned for this whole convo.	4
[NAME]	11
I'm 14 stone...so probably about 2 stone over weight. I don't drink alcohol or do drugs, but I love food.... 	18

I was suffering a delirium flu during the phantom facemask game so it‚Äôs all sorts of suffering for me.	25

I'm sorry OP, every single thing on that list is incredibly wrong. I hope you're doing well now. 	20
I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre referring to the poor execution of the hanging? He only used half of the holes	7
She has at least 12 elbows and all of them are happy. You get it gurl	17
Not surprised, damn that sucks. Concussions are awful.	11
Yes, it's normal. More like considering you options than desperation	4
Not all [NAME] supporters are tankies, but all tankies are [NAME] supporters	6
It's bizarre that it's considered normal to intentionally brainwash people into murdering psychos.	10
What do you think? If you look at my question above? Last thing I should do is to say sorry?	6
Bet flop. Good [NAME] what are you doing on the river.	7
Gamers know all too well how it feels to be oppressed by society.	4

I hope for the camera-man's sake that gun is empty	20
Please never don't not reproduce.	3
Source each of these and trend lines from previous years please. No, listing a few agencies and telling people to Google 8t isn't a source. 	10
Holy shit this golden comment flew under the radar. I laughed so hard	1
It‚Äôs like you didn‚Äôt even read the comment you‚Äôre responding to.	22
They hated him, because he told them the truth	25
I hope she lives to be 200, just to piss them off.	20
Eventually sure. But the question really lacked the maybe later option lol	1
Imagine what could've happened if you saw the longer director's cut!	7
I am more than pleasantly surprised I clicked this link	26

Good news: this is shark tale not finding Nemo	0

Thats insane. Someone died like 2 years ago after a bolt got kicked up by a truck and went through his windshield and hit him on 146 in LaPorte	16
Are you still sitting in the car right now?	7
He probably banked on the inherent secrecy of the community and ignorance (on Belgian law) of his victims.	3
[NAME] has to lose it a some point, just hope it's not tonight.	20
I feel awful posting it, but I couldn‚Äôt not share :|	11

OMG if the [NAME] and [NAME] run... I'll have the worst of time deciding who to vote for!	6
whats the [NAME] story ? sorry, not up to date on the bloke	7

Yeah no haha. Out of my price range tbh	1
wow! thats... a lot of water my dude was your bladder ok	26
Congrats, still waiting on getting called for an interview for another internal position. Applying around Christmas HR is so fucking slow.	15

Why? They deserve it.	7
I‚Äôm not sure it was [NAME] that changed the definition as much as it was the ATF.	6
100%. She's made herself vulnerable to being sued by a few people.	4
Only married once so can't be that bad. Not that it even matters	10
You're mistaking a poor character for MC.	9

Nice job building yourself btw	0

Finally gonna get together with [NAME]. Love is beautiful.	18
Ask him if he wants to a warm glass of shut the hell up.	3
I just dropped out of my science class without being at school, hot damn	9
The only time this movie should encourage blindfolds is when watching it. Then hopefully you won‚Äôt witness the giant plot holes and terrible ending.	20

My coffee burned its way through my nostrils. Thank you!	15

Everyday for the last year and a half has been very hard and I should be glad she's gone. I'm almost there.	17
Yea having children will always solve the problem	4
[NAME] and his supporters are the dumbest humans in the fucking galaxy. They should be locked up for their own safety.	2

The contempt from [NAME] in these threads lately is seriously disappointing.	9

I agree. That is a fight better left for later.	4
I enjoyed this TED talk.	17
He's trying!	4
So juicy i'm surprised the man from Del Monte isn't knocking at his door.	26
Oh I remember that final , I just dont want to involve my team in the conversation because we share a rivalry	3
Ya i hate to talk bad about don‚Äôt but they should get the sticks out of their butts and make smarter decisions for their community	2
"Comments like these are the biggest reason I get so pissed off about fucking centrists crying about the ""both sides"" argument. "	2

Company car? Oh boy he‚Äôs in trouble now.	26

He looks especially cute in the glasses.	0
Didn't find it believable even from the start	10
Would need the #1 overall in 2 years... should try to get a first in next years draft for AB and hope that team tanks	20
He probably does, but people don‚Äôt speak Godlish very well.	0
Haha I meant [NAME]. I was a very chatty fast bowler/no.6 pinch hitter.	1
I once looked at the I-95 and was hospitalised for weeks.	25
Its to bad he doesn‚Äôt give Tomlin this treatment.	10

Always great to see a fellow [NAME] give proper advice	0

That‚Äôs my favorite way to introduce myself tbh	4
Again nothing, you are the one obsessing over that term, he literally says he puts girls on a pedestal. 	3
Because majority of moves have stupidly long names. GO INTO ANGEL PUNISHER INTO DIVE BOMB RADIANCE AND FINISH THE JOB WITH PUNISHING LIGHT BLADE	2
This is a great thread for catching up on my block list. 10/10 would block again	0
I didn‚Äôt rely on them necessarily. I just dislike chiefs and [NAME] lol	1

Apologies, got a little carried away. 	25
Whoops. Didn‚Äôt know that was a thing. Thanks!	15
I didn't mean for that to sound racist I just mean those [NAME] in the article	10
That‚Äôs how I read it in the sentence but my brain reads it as ‚Äúyeahno‚Äù. Lol	1
well, i mean, he served his sentence and repaid his debt. is his punishment over, or is it forever?	7
I also posted about this a few days ago. Maybe they have different designers but none of them has follow-up or approval from a single person, unfortunate	9
[NAME] was my favorite. And I liked [NAME] her first season. They both suck now, so damn hard.	10
As much as I hate [NAME] I love the guy a lot	18

Maybe we‚Äôve been mishearing the word ‚Äòstarch‚Äô as ‚Äòstaunch‚Äô	22
I want to date that guy (platonic date). He‚Äôs big and could give great hugs.	8
Yes, this! You are too young to wasting your time with this. 	4
I live in a valley so it's effectively earlier than that for me.	4
What is it that you are posting twice all over the internet again?	7
Yea we‚Äôre actually pretty efficient on offense considering our personnel. Way better than I expected. The defense is just historically bad	9
Idk why you're surprised. [NAME] and [NAME] had identical philosophies. It's why the offense didn't change when he came back.	26
I'm sorry Mom, your child has autism, or this is a lie.	24
Same. Sometimes when people ask me the number to something I sing this to them and only get confused looks :(	6
That actually looks so fire	0
I have a moronphobia. I'm going to need to ask you to step away as I have an irrational fear and distaste of you.	14
Haven't listened to today's podcast yet, who did [NAME] kill?	7
Oh they can make numbers up too , good idea. Astroturfing starwars, this is the worst timeline.	0
I met her once and she ended up falling for me.	18
Wow random irrelevant internet person has the secret goods on [NAME]. Maybe we‚Äôll finally get to the bottom of this birth certificate thing...	26
WHAT. It says due date 12/31/18. Did she have the kid yet? Oh [NAME] I feel so bad for her and that child...... nooooooo	25
And here I am, with no promotion after 3 years. Anyways, congrats for yours.	9
* Fuck [NAME] * Yes	2
No, of course, no one has ever had his best axedwarve decapitated in the first goblin fight.	10
Here‚Äôs hoping this ends soon lol	1
Right but even without the FPTA surely we could have found ourselves in the same situation from a legal perspective?	7
I wish that show would come back	8
Lol too funny	1
Can‚Äôt wait to try this out	13
I'll try to stay patient.	20
What do you mean strap around the bulls nuts?!,!? Sorry not into rodeo things 	24
I was, and it's not. He's mad that someone posts articles he disagrees with. Pathetic and his fury is deranged 	2
Facebook is currently under fire for allegedly inflating their user base statistics by up to 50%. I'm not surprised they are having issues tracking money.	22
I went to the exhibit in Chicago some years ago. It‚Äôs absolutely stunning	0
Hey- that's where I play tennis! No slapshots, pls.	10
I actually currently have a girlfriend and I love her. It's just that those past situations gave me trust issues for life I guess.	18
Coming from [NAME] even though it‚Äôs a hypothetical question it‚Äôs still gotta feel scary	14
Love it yeet	18
You‚Äôre looking at clocking out of work two hours after you should have been finished, lol.	1
"Maybe it needs to be ""Hall of Shame"" instead of a museum."	10
I'm curious, what words were used? I cannot for the life of me conjure up the Hindi sentence for this in my brain	7
Thanks very much. This is helpful	15
Lol religion is a crazy thing	1
well there is something you cant say on this sub consider this strike 1	10
That as absolutely insane.	3
Exactly hate when people try to spit facts when they don‚Äôt know if those facts are even rightüòÇüòÇ	2
I think it's even sadder to go through someone's Reddit account looking for stuff like this to post.	25
And [NAME] should go sell his wife's ketchup. He's good for nothing else besides selling out our country.	10
I don‚Äôt think anyone will miss me either aha	25
Their numbers seem large because they get so much publicity. But I suspect that even most young people find that ludicrous.	11
It's the worst when it's something you are passionate about	11
Yeah I mentioned this route and how we won because the other teams kept wasting chances.	4
Thank you.	15
The poor car.	25
why arent they all laying on the floor???	6
So happy for you, enjoy 	17
That‚Äôs why I called them Turd Gen, haha. Getting a High Country/Denali with the 6.2 to replace it. 	1
wow that's dark	13
My t levels are normal. Doctor thinks its my low carb diet but I dont buy that	10

That does help a bit, thanks.	15
Damnit - I'm blind. It's 6am here - I should really go to sleep, but I want to see what happens next.	9
NCAA is a poor barometer for scoring. [NAME] was leading scorer in all NCAA for like 3 years running. Not even sure he got drafted.	9
I love how someone put a laughing emoji on that.	18
Ooh! Ooh! I want to lose more than 5-10 vanity pounds! (...wink wink)	13
Like always i will wait and see thanks for the post tho [NAME]	15
Don't see it at all, but she's cute with the freckles	0
It is not selfish to end a relationship that is causing you great stress and you feel is over despite loving them.	5
Same can be said for fragile liberals who can't handle cultural traditions and keep trying to push the envelope.	4
I can‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs real	26
B, I dont frink coffee anyways 	10
Faceee, you see all those models, be it plus sized, underweight or fit, all have one thing in common , good facial features	0
Oi he got stabbed in the eye	25
Reason number 1523648856 PFF is trash no one should take seriously	3
I'm happy however those two don't get a ring. Would be overjoyed if it was at the hands of [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME].	17
Ever since I could squat, deadlift, and bench more than my father he never questioned my decision. haha	1
It's only 5 mins, but I hope this is the one. Sorry that happened to you friend.	24
But everybody got mad when Russia recognized [NAME] as US president. Go figure.	2
This is why I love Reddit.	18
I love the sense of humor on this sub. It gets me.	0
I‚Äôm so sorry. <3	24
Hot damn.	0
I mean he's still not wrong. A traitor did bring out the worst in him then.	4
She liked the bumper sticker so much she decided to get it for herself	18
So true it hurts.	25
I love snow! It means snow days!	18
this video made me feel like screaming	14
Honestly acid is fun with 4-6 friends and shrooms is fun with 1-3 friends	1
i didnt realize i was avoiding a question. i am afraid to talk to cops to be honest. even my own mother doesnt know what i saw	14
It looks like Livonia flipped light blue as well? That‚Äôs pretty impressive.	0
I‚Äôm in the same boat with anthropology. 8 months post graduation. Still no job prospects. Glad I‚Äôm not alone	15
My misunderstanding, I thought you were questioning why people thought we needed a change.	24
>It's always possible they will bring back an older villain that is behind [NAME] Ah yes. I can't wait for the [NAME] 3.0/Snoke 2.0	13
That makes sense, thanks	15
I laughed at this 4 years ago.	1
She was carrying all my burdens >:((	25
I was just about to comment this. Do people think throwing an lol at the end of everything will just make it fine and dandy. Ridiculous lol.	1
How dare u/Reijka92 disrespect [NAME] like that!	2
Who exactly are their ‚Äòvolunteers‚Äô? The IRA?	7
You bomb them and they come your way 'cause you're a real winner!/s	0
True but stranger things have happened.	4
I feel for you (at a title 1 middle school in lausd) I had a tough day today and reading this made me feel a little better ‚úäüèº	4
Never seen this. Thank you for sharing	15
This guy is a hack lmao	1
Yes, we no longer have the necessity to eat animal products. Thus the only difference is pleasure.	22
I think [NAME] has a pretty unconventional face, also [NAME]	0
I love when the subreddit shows [NAME] some love! We have so many people that keep an ear to the ground for quality [NAME] content.	18
I just want the last couple [NAME] nerfs rolled back, she's still good but not as fun. 	8
$9?! Yeah you git ripped off, hope you kept the receipt pal r/sarcasm	20
Entire new coaching philosophy is needed. Enough wasted possessions, contested iso mid-range jumpers with 15 seconds left on the shot clock and terrible 3pt defense.	4
Why would there be? HOTS heroes always have been and always will be BLIZZARD heroes, not Activision	7
My bf uses profanity, and I don't care. There's no reason for misogyny though.	10
thank you, i dont get whats so hard to come to such an easy solution honestly	15
We're going to return to [NAME] and [NAME] being bffs again and talking shit about [NAME] or some other random shit.	3
Keep yourself occupied go play videogames or something that really occupies your attention	5
It is so good to hear from you. Stay safe!	5
Best! Episode! Ever! There is like a joke every 20 seconds.	17
Thank you for the correction. I'll make sure to be careful of that in the future.	15
I wouldn't volunteer a second honestly. That weather is not worth it, and neither are your coworkers.	10
Welp these were my happy tears of the days. :‚Äô)	17
Bold of you to assume just about everyone here wouldn't do this for you, you absolute gem	0
Thanks everybody!	15
Thank you!!	15
I always thought the swat was trash because I was looking at the MP TTK and only did I realise recently that MP guns and BO guns handle differently	22
Wow, I wasnt expecting that to be a real sub lol that's awesome	0
I meant to say provincial ban on smoking in it not law yet?	6
Haha, that's terrifying 	1
Yep...and they regret it. I hope you stay together!	20
Listen to it while you're sad	5
That's false	10
I'm tired i'm wasted I LOVE YOU DARLING.	18
If I haven‚Äôt told you lately...I love you and you are my hero. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è	18

LOL men don't have feelings ;)	1
my heart melted omg [NAME]	18
This game is actually worse than I was anticipating and I knew it was gonna be bad	11
If only someone would love the septuple-PhD in the galaxy for her mind.lol	1
It's showtime!!	13
Lol what are the odds, I‚Äôm also 6ft 1in around the 160s but I‚Äôm only 16 years old though	1
I‚Äôm so sorry you are going through this. Sounds like an awful experience.	25
[NAME] has an amazing track record. I think some people forget how innovative and unpredictable the [NAME] era offense was.	0
Finally, one win for the war on drugs!	17
Agreed, if you think about the animals it's sad. If you think about zerocarbers' blood profiles it gets amusing.	4
Hi, I just fix it, I just had to clear the cookies	4
This is the most adorable thing I've been made aware of. Possibly ever. You are being super sweet.	0
Thats fine as long as the creative director is still there.... Though the talent will be missed	4
Thanks for your recommendation! My guy loves board games and those sound like they'd scratch our itches.	15
Yep... I'd vote to oust these mavericks as well!	4
She could and should pursue modeling! It seemed like every time she was on screen, my sister and I were saying how effortlessly beautiful she is!!	0
Thanks man, likewise for you	15
You've been checking in on all us 3.8 billion females? That's impressive.	0
I‚Äôm *BEGGING* that they get it right by the time [NAME] shows up.	8
If you have bo toleramce you could feel it for a day	5
i want my nuggs mom!	8
I suppose. It was just weird how they went on a NASCAR tangent for like 3 minutes lol.	11
Ya got a good life... *ya got a good life...*	17
Wait, you have friends that love you? You're gonna be okay dude. I promise. 	5
Nice try, bot!	0
Reddit culture is truly the worst.	11
After dating 2 of them, I can say I fully agree.	20
Sadly it happens randomly and I wouldn't want to lie to someone for money if the thoughts didn't appear.	25
A lawyer is not going to disclose anything to random users, you guys are delusional	10
Only thing TO know is that this motherfucker is obviously living his best birdy life and good for him. Fly high little buddy, fly high. 	2
More like trash ass link. Wtf is ‚ÄúApple Music‚Äù, probably some shitty limewire ripoff.	2

I've heard of alligator boots, but I always thought that meant something else.	22
Ahhhh fond memories	17
Have to stay positive! I AM getting a new job I love in the field I want to work in!	18
Yes but iy also makes complete sense that morty woild want it gone too, so i hate how he instantly assumes it was rick	2
[NAME] is a cute woman, A Shyster, but cute.	0
Sounds painful man	25
"The sound ISN'T mixed terribly like in high school kids and a nice taxidermised bear in the USA, a beautiful day!""."	0
Is that the cobbler in the background of the family portrait? This is great.	0
Yeah, right. [NAME] can marry [NAME] for that matter, as it seems only his genius is keeping her on the throne.	13
As a kid, I was way more excited to see the [NAME] truck.	13
Right? I was kind of hoping [NAME] would get to take a crack at it.	20
You're right!	4
Sub... chill... I see what you did there...	4
It's not exactly hard to keep track.	10
This probably not a good file to keep on your phone if you are accessing this from within...	3
Middle guy doesn't look to fit to me. Looks like me, too many pounds.	10
Yes, I wouldn't have said it if it weren't true lol. It's owned by InBev which is a Belgian company. 	1
my parents got engaged in the courtyard of [NAME] back in the 70s	17
I remember being three years old and feeling mortified and frustrated that my preschool teacher and classmates were freely dancing to ridiculous music.	25
No. We wouldn‚Äôt have enough room to play them all and each of them would add like 10-15 mill in luxury tax. EACH.	10
This sub is turning into r/childfree so fast. I actually love kids and want to adopt someday. I want to mod this sub smh	18
I was so scared, I thought the kid was going to backpedal into a street.	14
Hope she can do twice a week, that ought to be persuasive.	20
I would love if a double amputee walked in and have watched as they decline the poor fellar service	18
Apologies. My point still stands. A .8% lead is an insignificant majority at best. Saying one demograohic is most of the population is a bit misleading	24
Don't call this baby a jerk It just loves its humans too much	18
Thanks for sharing that info. I'll see how low I can go. Did you do a trade in?	15
I am confusion!	6
There has to be someone that loves you, you just may not see it right now. 	4
The frankness of this comment made me giggle	17
A burned hand teaches best, after that advice about fire goes to the heart.	22
Yay let‚Äôs get nice and pissed	13
I would be more offended to be served cereal on a plate.	3
I'm going to Chicago in a few months. I hear Sbarro's is great for authentic Chicago style pizza.	0
Going from [NAME] to [NAME] on the PP is like going from tenderloin to convenience store hotdogs	3

I'm sad we have you at home this year. I want to make a trip to see Allianz.	25
Eh, 3. I don't know why. I told him this but he's afraid his life is ruined.	6
If it‚Äôs a one hit kill like the regular crossbow, absolutely would be a fantastic crate weapon.	4
Turn off your phone, computer or even the internet. It is scary to do but just for now when the urges hits.	14
I like it	18
This guy fucking gets it.	2
Dude take the medicine. It helps.	5
Look what time it is. It's Fuck You, It's January!	26
This is awful.	11
Can confirm, girl asked my out on a second date and my comfort levels and confidence sky rocketed	4
Good to know, thanks for response 	15
I wonder what was more painful, the stitches or the humiliation.	7
I'm convinced alcoholism is rife in Ireland because ourselves and friends are all shite craic sober. Apparently the Heineken fake beers are nice.	4
Why do the people there lose their jobs? Not doubting you, I just don't understand those rehab centers. 	6
Maybe it‚Äôs a cultural thing? That‚Äôs the way we do it in (I assume from my experience) Canada.	7
BREAKING NEWS: The new girl had to shred/chip a 6lb entire chub of Kentucky Gold ham today. Poor girl's arm ached the rest of the day.	25
So you got a more expensive burger while following the rules?	7
[NAME] it‚Äôs ok the trumpet player can‚Äôt hurt you anymore	5
almost every single time i have a friend from out of state visit, they make a comment about how bumpy our roads are	10
get your ass to mars!	3
Ty. I confessed and they are being very nice to me. My kids are safe and me going to therapy is a plus now.	15
The lack of teabags is the only emergency here. You thwarted an attack on your child.	10

Thanks, came here for this	15
Congratulations! :)	0
Ah man great memories .. campaigns were soo memorable	0
Absolutely. That was an amazing set of games. Didn‚Äôt miss a beat	0
i love casual racism	18
Seeing as how someone was raping her, it doesn't surprise me that much that the facility would be so negligent that they wouldn't notice the pregnancy.	9
But if [NAME] wins... well, things might change.	20
I wish my nickname was [NAME]	8
Scotland aren‚Äôt the best team to compare against. On their day the could debatably beat NZ on a bad day they lose to America	25
Love hearing stories like this. [NAME] holy Priests are such a gift. We must always give thanks and pray for them.	15
thank you!!	15
"I think you missed a ""ba"""	9
How is recognizing a sovereign country as a country hate?	7
Go for it, it will be a new experience it may not go good but you'll learn someway 	4
Sounds like some people could just be a bit confused and maybe not been to a drive thru before	22
i didn't know this could happen.	22
Glad to see [NAME] are finally admitting they are babies who are unable to take care of themselves.	17
That's incredible. There was 3000 last I checked just over 2 years ago.	0

Reddit hates women.	3
MTV loves Indiana	18
Not about my first name but I'm gonna change my last name.	4
Nope, try to keep up.	5
That‚Äôs another unfair accusation. I spent a lot of time trying to reach an understanding with you.	10
Her Twitter checks also clearly a fucking idiot.	2
Thank you for understanding. We don't want to be mean, but the rules must be enforced at all levels for all participants. Good luck with your endeavors!	15
How exciting.	13
Thank you. It happened suddenly. Near the end of the game.	15
So cool! Me and my sissy got the same but on our arms! On twitter!	17

Definitely my favorite reliever after Mo. loved his attitude and competitiveness.	18
Sorry, should've mentioned... 	24
Why aren‚Äôt you using dark mode	7
No worries. Just giving you a hard time!	5
I considered becoming a teacher, but then I considered the little bastards would eat me alive.	10
Wow, after the past 2 seasons that seems like it was like 6 years ago.	13
Then the argument is entirely wrong. Democratic socialist are not communists. Conservatives aren't fascists.	10
The best part about this is that everyone was trolled from Fox to the Mary Shitbag	1
I'm so sorry	25
LOL to your family	1
I‚Äôll take one [NAME] please	8
Fortnite is not a good game anymore smh my head	10
I hope he‚Äôs a hit for the contract he got. Looking forward to seeing him.	20
1.0mg is a high dose. My husband is an insomniac and can't take that dose without nightmares.	5
Is everybody forgetting that bills need to be signed by the president to become law, or get 2/3rds support in both chambers if not?	7
Ehhh I don‚Äôt know, I still find it kind of cringey with the ‚Äú[NAME]‚Äù talk and all that stuff.	12
You deserve this	4
Had a stroke reading these.	26
Citation found, dumbass.	3
Welcome to The World of... Mobile MMOs. Where power can be yours, for a price.	17
I like [NAME] but she fucking sucks right now for the all star game haha.	1

At least the ice didnt break	23
As fun as that sounds, please just call the police.	1
How the hell do you get downvoted for a submission statement on /r/TrueReddit. Title or not it is still required.	3
I got the feeling too. It's possible, or the ground is just rough. 	4
...to win the popular vote, which she easily did.	4
I used to work nights at a 24-hour Walmart, ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù is a damn tame word for it.	13

My 4 month old just got her second round of shots, so yeah, we feel you. Hope you're able to get a good rest!!	20
Yeah but shortly after got disinterested so i broke it to her lol	1
This grammar is horrible. Discovering something is a fixed single point in history which should have been simple past ‚Äúwas‚Äù instead of ‚Äúhad been.‚Äù	14
Well, I could already do that. But glad to have BCH as a pathway	15
"Can we change the ""haha"" one to when he was laughing about giving that scarecrow to [NAME] "	1

I visited NYC 2 summers ago and I have the same exact feeling as you do. Glad you liked the city just as much as I did!	17
I'm saying put up or shut up. If you can't back up your point with evidence, your opinion is worthless. 	2
That‚Äôs not munchausen. She has a diagnosed illness that‚Äôs a terrible, terrible one to suffer from. This is a pretty shitty reply.	14

Fuck you I was in the bed:/	2

No! My furniture is floating!	10
I'm shocked, shocked, to find that redditors don't read sources and stay with the info they get from the misleading titles. 	26
Yeah the question makes no sense without more context.	3
I am very thankful for that. And thankful I wasn‚Äôt totally brainwashed	15
Thanks! Sometimes you need an article in order to shake some sense into someone.	15
You just made me so happy.	17
Love the idea for the [NAME] skin but I think it might be too hard :/	18
I wonder the same thing. Where could I go where no one would ever find me. I usually come around to dropping myself in the millworks.	7
Don't tell yourself those lies. They only serve to keep that weight in place. We're all lucky to have you. You're a gem	0
My favorite thing about this is that OP doesn‚Äôt clarify which item he‚Äôs so excited about.	18
You have much to learn	5

You're willing to lie about anything to shill for [NAME].	10
The level of denial the top boys reached was astonishing.	26
I agree she‚Äôs not fat, but that is Photoshopped and posed into oblivion.	4
Hard to expect much when he has not been involved in the offense for most of the season.	10
its great that she takes care of you, but remember to let her know that she can lean on you	0
Anybody else feel super weird when you see your dad get hurt? It‚Äôs a weird thing to see	3
This is a good change. I've heard too many sad stories on Tinder about this sort of thing, looking for a way out. 	4
I'm still a little surprised at how god awful that defense was. The Bengals definitely have some talent to work with.	26
Wow. AP should find that video and flag whoever did that...deep, scary issues at play	14
I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.	14
I like [NAME]. Sue me.	18
Okay I can see why that is one glorious beard	4
It's hard to try to evaluate yourself, but I appreciate you trying.	0
Damn didn‚Äôt see it sorry	24

Good to know my paranoia has paid off haha, and same, sooo many snacks.	1

Aaahhh u got a spanking. Lol	1
Sorry, my phrasing was terrible. Not across the board, but eggs are definitely an example where OP was right.	24
Honestly, back then, seeing her squirm would have been perfect. I'm mildly curious to see if she's still scared of me, though.	7
Wow City all of a sudden not so invincible anymore, have as many defeats as us now...	26
Thank you, lightwaves. Very cool.	15

You know I‚Äôm sad the [NAME] hype is over because I actually think he‚Äôs been really good for us overall. I still trust him.	25
When the gov shut down under [NAME] many were calling for his resignation. This is similar, but people already hate [NAME] so obviously people are more angry.	2
He's back! I missed him. He is the most entertaining thing on this sub.	13

[NAME] is a moron. Why take the ball away from your best player and give arguably the best RB in the nation the chance to run it out.	2
I see. Thanks again for taking the time. I'm very isolated from the world so It's good to finally talk to someone about those things.	15

Revolver is pretty beast tho, 2 shot close range	0
Oh ok! Thanks for the info.And oh [NAME] I can‚Äôt imagine what that would feel like	15
It's also cruel how noone is informed about the execution at all. Relatives are left completely in the dark and likely never find out about their execution.	11
no it is not the same. At the level of 3k in income then it may seem the same or trivial to bother with though.	10

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ORIGINAL	7
[NAME] so much hate.	2
Barring an injury, [NAME] will be up by May at the latest. You're not going to sign him for one month.	10
None of the movies deserve it and honestly the oscars are a sham at this point.	10
That's pretty much what you signed up for when you had kids.	17
[NAME] is my top choice. Love the tape and could anchor the line for many years	18
the last 2 are mocking the first you dumb asses	3
Are you one of them? Sorry. You asked for it. üòÇ	7
We need these people on our side; arguing with them may be both thankless and fruitless, but the argument must be put to them. 	10
Fun fact: 3 is both my favorite number and my lucky number!	1
It means that [NAME] campaign colluded, contrary to them saying otherwise. Sorry if you voted to advance Russian interests.	24
Turns out, that daddys little girl is a thot, who also takes drugs. No wonder she fled her country.	25

It looks like it may be some type of munchkin cat since it has short legs	7
Yes, I realize that. All my other relationships have been a year or longer but even a month into those I was miserable 	22
Debunked as in proven wrong. Again, he is a well known fool. Do yourself a favor and never take anything he says remotely seriously. 	2
If that‚Äôs true, and I‚Äôm inclined to agree, term limits are a bandaid on an open chest wound. 	4
Nah. Been over it pretty much since [NAME] said the Vikings did it too. Pretty hard to be mad when we were just as guilty.	24
Glad you're at least out of bed. Progress!	17
You clearly don't have a clue about [NAME] career so don't start worrying about it now.	19

Are you surprised. He doesn‚Äôt do anything with himself	26
Thank you OP , I can finally look at a picture of [NAME] without vomiting. 	15
Searching is fun, and finding and learning all the spawns is satisfying.	20
[NAME] sorry it was rude not to @ you lol	24
Everything he does makes me love him, including his video application for his job at Polygon which is art.	18
Healthier and more disgusting.	11
Yea we're already in last place, those 3 missing assures nothing lol.	1
Yep. I‚Äôve done a couple shoots at Hornsby small bore and one clay pidgeon day at Lucas Heights.	4
Lopez is a better rim protector but I get your point	0

I would love to accidentally get muscular... Instead of working my arse off to lose fat at the moment.	18

How stupid of [NAME] to rely on LibDems to stop the idea of referendum.	3
You are a wize man. This was a brilliant conversation	0

Well.... it‚Äôs even more weird to drink the milk of other species..so...	11
Why is it ethically wrong for him to lose half his shit? In what context?	7
I love how they have it on the dog. Imagine a fur missile going after a suspect flashing red and blue.	18
Absolutely same.	4
I Will! Thank you. I have applied for gaelic studies. (Bet not many international students do that but hey, it's a lovely language)	15
Which is stupid because conversations about race and slavery in America are primarily about race in slavery in America.	3

You can still check your feelings and then see how they‚Äôre messing up your facts.	22
I tell them I've been a fan since the very beginning of the franchise, so there's no way I could be a bandwagoner	3
You really can't. So just dont worry about it	5
Bunch of incels	3

Great, another article from a guy who thought making [NAME] the head coach was the answer.	0
I know I should be worried, but I am not, which makes me very worried. 	14
Ladies and Gentlemen........We got him	17
2005? I think we might be the same person lol. What a terrible year. I go back to that one a lot.	14

Oh trust me, I thought of that - but I felt as though the phallic shape would cheapen the resemblance to feces 	22
Isn‚Äôt it against company policy to sell things in the store that have nothing to do with Starbucks	7
Yeah I was impressed with it too! I've to pay to see results of responses past the 100th one but other than that it's top notch	0
There‚Äôs a big difference between ‚ÄúI felt bad for her but there was nothing I could do‚Äù and ‚Äúnot my problem.‚Äù	9

For some reason, I thought this was one of his Bros trying to save him from her.	5

Show down there heretic. You obviously meant to say: Unquestionable truth, any diversion from what seems to be true only comes from our own limitations. /s	3
To be fair he probably is saying that.	4
Happy new year to you too! :>	13
And based on the film of [NAME] novel *Johnny Got His Gun*, both worth checking out.	0
No, it would not. How the hell is that evidence that [NAME] didn't commit the crime?	2

Huh. That‚Äôs kind of crazy.	13

Every time I see a something like, 'thanks for nothing, [NAME],' I mentally apologize to her, lol. 	1
I‚Äôm sure losing obj will help [NAME] get out of his slump, or help develop whichever rookie qb they bring in. 	4
Thing is, some fans will *never* be happy. There is nothing that can be done to please them. That's the problem.	9
Damn rui lol. Serving looks.	1
"The real power move is to write ""Have a nice day"" even if you lose."	22

Close your damn mouth before it catches a fly	3

[NAME] was pretty cool on The Challenge so I would love to see him on CBB.	18

Unfortunately, on that we can agree.	4

It isn't complicated at all. You are growing up. Congrats.	15

Exactly. How that woman has survived two no confidence votes amazes me.	26

I know North America is a big place but I wonder what it will take to see similar crowds in cities over here.	26
[NAME] from ZoE and [NAME] from TTGL. Actually fuck all that [NAME] from The Big O is where it's at.	2
I hate roundabouts. For some reason road designers have a fetish for them as more and more are popping up. For cyclist they are rings of death	2
And then the oligarchs in charge will be forced to say how they really feel about America... this bizarre logic has very interesting potential.	0
Well that sucks	3

I‚Äôm sure [NAME] was thinking this when he told his daughter that she stunk like a toilet on his deathbed.	4
This is cute.	0
Why slum it if they‚Äôre giving you actual cost?	10

You first! Make it more interesting than this!	7

Sorry, I misread	24
I always compared him to [NAME].	4
Danggit. Im mad i didn't think of that	3

New flavour! I love it!	18

I like [NAME] but he's got bizarre mechanics on his jumper and no arc.	18
Proof of [NAME] love for mankind, beer and dogs. Love both and abuse neither.	18

Sorry the cognitive dissonance is too much for you. Why don't you go back to listening to Nickelback? It'll make you feel better :)	24
Time consuming too, but buying a box that size outright is stupidly expensive‚Äîeven if you order a bundle of 25 at a time.	10
I just saw that they deleted their account. Good.	4
I watch it every time I see it posted. There's something beautiful about watching someone so passionate and excited about what they've discovered :)	0
Happy cake day [NAME]	17
I love Florida	18
>i told him we weren't sick we were just on drugs. Lol unexpected	1
Sounds racist, fetishistic, sexist, and objectifying.	3
This is the sad truth for the exact reason he mentioned, they want a short fix to avoid doing this type of hard work.	25
You‚Äôre killing me. Let a brotha know next time lol	1
Sorry about that!	24
If you feel it's harassment, you have the ability to report the post for harassment.	5
Actually it's quite hard to decide without a proper reason. Under what circumstances do we have to do that?	7
I have no idea if this is sarcasm...	6
Sorry. I read that as newly white and it cracked me up.	24
Congratulations, you can into geolibertarianism	15
OMG was he really 5000 favorite?	7
I hope that's all it is. Didn't see him take a hit or anything.	10
[NAME] and [NAME] may be stronger, but [NAME] just gone mad. She's lost the plot for sure.	3
> It‚Äôs really not that difficult to win in this league lol	1
here‚Äôs hoping the same is true for me!	20
I really love that this sub has it's own little culture	18
Sure, let's kill a guy with a buck on his horse because that's how it was in the old west. Smh	4
good to see your story had a happy ending!	17
Aw, she came home early to surprise you! She must have missed you a lot.	26
Can‚Äôt see him doing well in the premier league tbh. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he ends up wishing he stayed at Dortmund.	9
Nice try Gillette	0
Taking a charge up 30. I love this team	18
Do you know what caused the relapse? Identify the cause of failure so you won't repeat the same mistake.	7
Ahhh I misread your comment as ‚ÄúIf I noticed a car on a flat bed with no straps.‚Äù	22
"Thanks to me, my grandma now refers to to [NAME] as ""the lizard""."	15
Exactly my point	4
Man, I miss those days. LA is pretty much dead now.	9
I love how it stops just before the impact	18
Being so rare and only giving you bad luck? Fake news	10
Thank you for these helpful points. I‚Äôll read them again later.	15
My man's on the left looks like he's trying too guard precious	5
What year did I wake up in?	6
Love [NAME]. Amazing beaches!	0
When was this? Is it in opposition to the coup?	6
> Why do you think you're in financial hell? He spends the rest on drugs according to his post history.	7
It is pretty funny. Our wives cannot stand when we're all together because it's all we talk about lol	1
And how often the Asian guy is the token gay guy (especially since Uncle George came out). What I would give for more Asian romantic leads!	7
Focus on yourself and not on finding a relationship. It sounds like you have a lot of personal issues to work on and are projecting your problems.	5
Love the guy complaining the panel is stacked against the rich what with all the high tax rhetoric. *The WORLD is stacked against the rest of us.*	18
Yeah they taste so fake!!	10
It still seems Fairy popular, I might get it. Thanks for the tip!	15
E - Either we turn it around and make the playoffs or tank and [NAME] gets fired so win win right?	20
Yes, I know. But thanks, no damage to the second car and just some scratches on mine.	15
Just found my new phone background. This is amazing, keep it up!	13
I know right? Getting that wrong would‚Äôve de-railed the joke.	20
I wonder if that was the original plan or if [NAME] just realized what [NAME] talked about and threw in that note to explain it.	7
What? I don‚Äôt just want to sleep with him. I want more idk... I value myself	10
I'm a girl and got the belt for doing something similar with another girl.	4
Most accurate of the 5 places I've seen this today.	22
Great snap. Try again in a week when the lights are on at the aus open.	0
I recognized a word!	22
It doesn‚Äôt help	10
You've aged horribly'	14
This sub is becoming a ‚ÄúGamers rise up‚Äù parody of itself. This is ridiculous.	3
I was afraid things would if we kept seeing each other, which is why I brought this up to her now rather than later. 	14
Even if it‚Äôs available 24/7 on your new website 99% of it is ugly so people still won‚Äôt buy it.	11
Did you know your post about your comment being downvoted is also being downvoted?	7
Are those the numbers from last season? [NAME] is a significantly better player this year than he was last year	0
In 10 years, she‚Äôs still be a loser.	10
I'm sorry. Does Scholomance exist in the World of Ice and Fire?	24
This seems like a massive cope. But do whatever makes you happy.	4
I really like this one.	0
Awesome! Thanks a lot. Brings back memories	15
That‚Äôs what I meant, sorry bout that. Never fold AKs pre 	24
Stay strong and keep going. Chiche but true : living well is the best revenge .	5

"""Why everyone hurts me?"""	25
How dare you care about your physical and mental health, you shitlord you! /s	2
You're the reason [NAME] won the election. There isn't anything even remotely resembling fascism in the United States. Get a grip.	3
Weird flex but ok	4
Dammit, I thought I put it at the bottom. Sorry.	24
I bid my condolences to any player who did not experience release day action. ‚Äú*Glorious battles, tooth and nail* *Noobs arrived, our matches grew stale*‚Äù	9
I hate people who can't *read* Dx	2
I recognize this YouTube channel... They make beautiful furniture. This has to be at customer request. I have no idea how to explain it otherwise.	0
Thanks GM & Ford!	15
At least she can eat Abel or something so we don't have to worry about feeding her.	23
I'm a guy and I'm squirming. My wife asked me what the hell I was reading and I told her. She said wtf really loud.	19
I‚Äôm genuinely surprised that [NAME] didn‚Äôt believe [NAME] lipstick speech - like that shit genuinely moved me	26
It might be the other way around! They seem to have a lot of awkward conversations while eating dinner.	3
> 2. Give me any evidence that women don't want to date me.	7
as a woman, I can tell ya it‚Äôs not uncommon for that to happen, haha. [NAME] make it extra sad though.	25
It's very hard to un-brainwash someone. Damn near impossible	10
Good. It's weird that Polish gun culture is nearly non-existent, given their history as a country. Hopefully this is a step toward fixing that.	0
Great for moderate sedation in the ER!	0
Guess I'm seriously out of shape, I should do something about that. Maybe next week...	9
Just stop.	2
Why are you so angry?	2
It‚Äôs copypasta from like 2004 lol	1
I was a huge fan of the script ones but the new greens this season look pretty fresh on ice, too. I like bringing the red back in	0
this would work!!	20
At least no one threw water on him and exacerbated things	23
I wouldn't have thought if you hadn't mentioned Harry Potter. I appreciate the reminder. Teamwork!	15
He closed the stream with a song of hers, while hugging his skele-buddy. It was a good song.	0
>Yes, I know that you like to talk about yourself a lot :P I do use a lot of words. It's actually embarrassing. 	12
If we trade him I don‚Äôt think be will be a playoff team :(	9
That's very incoherent	6
That just shows how similar people can be in this kind of situation, demanding, rude, and can sometimes damage stuff without care	2
Well done Kepa get in!!!!	0
Good job for politicising a tribute to a local TV show beloved by many.	15
We just got paper straws and we have to ask everyone if they want one first. it's anoying.	3
5% more people identifying as liberal than conservative, 4.3% more people supporting the tax rates. [NAME] activated	4
Coming back pretty strong with UFC Fortaleza at least. [NAME] vs. Moicano has me excited	13
Fuck why didn‚Äôt I think of that	2
That‚Äôs been arguably his strongest attribute this season?	7
That game was one of the craziest I‚Äôve ever been to	13
wouldn't you say [NAME] and [NAME] are part of the same generation?	7
Thanks for keep us posted	15
I wonder if she unliked you? That'd then make sense for the rest of it.	4
Isnt that the god awful truth	7
It was in a downward trend since 9 years ago, thanks [NAME]! 	15
Thank you for this encouragement. It's been a very long time since I've made any progress	15
In fact the South side of Chicago is the baddest part of town	9
He's being so unprofessional. He's out for blood for some reason.	3
Welcome to racial integration, where your civility standards are racist and you better shut up or else.	3
Fucking hate [NAME]..	2
Not a chance on this	10
No, I just haven't seen that here, and I wanted you to show me that's all.	8
I wish you have a best luck on your journey.	5
Try Rescue Melatonin Strawberry gummies and Natural Calm in hot water. They saved my life.	5
There is a reason 15 people liked my comment dear, those fifteen people all think you are pretty. I hope you see this... üëì	20
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **1st Cakeday** SirVortivask! ^(hug)	17
Haha look at these liberals crying about children being raped in cages haha what snowflakes haha	1
Because sometimes the middle is still wrong	10
the act of using private companies as platforms to push indoctrination is no less vile than state run companies	3
One of those is not like the others.	10

If he's mailing you cash, and you're waiting to ship the item until payment is received, i'm confused how this would be a scam.	6
Socialism?!?! But le higher taxes!!	7
At some point you just gotta say, that‚Äôs impressive. This isn‚Äôt that point. 	6
Thank you! Well put I am not the best at putting my thoughts into words so well said thank you that was the point I was going for!	15

"Thats what makes me think OP is secretly the ""nice guy"" here."	0
That awkward moment when people who passionately hate [NAME] inadvertently portray him as a hero.	12
Yep. When precedent is very right-wing ‚Äòcentrism‚Äô is just ‚ÄúI fundamentally believe we shouldn‚Äôt move left any significant amount‚Äù	4
Game: ok get out now Nea: a Game: no fuck you nea u toxic af	2
yep, its still time based so 1st will be absolutely raking it in 	4
Apart from the flashy plating, it's probably the most famous dutch restaurant and has 3 Michelin stars. I hope they don't serve mediocre food there	20
I earned the money, I bought the food and I cooked the food so don't go thanking your phoney baloney god for it in my home.	10
What are you listening to?	7
I don't think so. I think he is courting a secular crowd of young confused secular people searching for meaning in their lives.	6
Hoping you‚Äôre gonna experience a ton of good days from here on out dude	20
He‚Äôs a professional liar making promises to get elected when all he concerned with is a power gain.	2

Thanks mate. I‚Äôll incorporate that into my game. Thanks mate.	15
Thanks for the review, comments, etcetera.	15
Yes. She should. Just not President. I've heard people say she should, and she is nowhere near ready for that. 	4
I'm British and this has definitely happened to me.. but why is it just [NAME]?	7
It just has to be clean and hygienic. Maybe make sure you got food and wine on deck	8
You‚Äôre doing a fantastic job at keeping things together. Have faith that you‚Äôre on the right track, and things WILL work them-self out.	0
Yeah I don't think so lol	4
Thank you for your help	15
Whoa now, easy there on the logic.	13
Nah I didn‚Äôt get scammed but my money is sitting in the Dream Market escrow doohickey. Whatever that means! Haha!	10
Just go try and by one piece fan after got end!	5
I have no idea what that means.	6
I don't know	6
Partywolf had 178 losses in a row? Are you seeious? I can't believe that	7
But he has... so it‚Äôs not that he can‚Äôt but that he shouldn‚Äôt.	10
I like His And Hers Poker Podcast	18
Man I didn't think our fanbase was this delusional.	10
I enjoyed that Bagel Boss commercial. Suddenly craving some Greiss Coffee.	17
No, I prefer having a forest	10
Interesting trend. Just wait till they learn about the church's racism and history claims....	7
That's what I can't understand either, what were they expecting by knocking on the door?	6
Finally! Somebody who legitimately hates planet Jupiter!	23
Extremely painful to watch	25
I really need to get more sleep.	8
We're trying to be 3-16 on the road with a positive point differential lol	1
I love daddy long neck and crew. You won‚Äôt be disappointed when you look it up.	18
You‚Äôre a genius.	0
You're making me look bad [NAME], while she yells and screams.	2
As of right now, [NAME] is the better overall player.	0
What a game... completely down and out at half time and then... [NAME] and total annhilation of the scousers	13
are you printing labels through ebay/paypal/other online service? You get a discount there. If you're paying retail, stop it. 	3
**You are breaking the car!**	2
Start a relaxing bedtime routine. Goggle sleep hygiene and make sure yours is good. Get over your weird thing about reading and try it!	5
I'm clueless as to what I could be clueless about too, [NAME]. What is the difference? Aren't all video games ultimately 'no lifeing' it?	6
This kinda looks like something shot in the style of Reno 911. Especially the bit where the cops look back and simultaneously say ‚ÄúJaywalking!‚Äù	4
What's really sad is that [NAME] wants to outlaw gay dads. I'm literally shaking.	25
Lies, damn lies and statistics. 	2
I love it in spades	18
Xbox 360. I‚Äôve never gamed before so I‚Äôm excited.	13

You‚Äôre an animal, and you deserve all the shame/repercussions you get.	2
If you all keep nagging me with this question I will turn this car around and then *no one‚Äôs* getting to watch the trailer.	3
Shhhh, don‚Äôt say that, your going to trigger a millennial 	10
I bought milk and honey for its cover. ended up loving it anyway.	17
If it were [NAME] being negative about Korea, would you be equally happy to see it banished?	10
i managed to craft that super early in the game and i was so disappointed that i basically could not get drunk	9
This literally broke my heart	9
Oh, did they innovate anything I would recognize with their obscenely large financial investments? :):):):)	7
[NAME] why did they have to remove the OP? Her story is heartbreaking and she appears to only want some sort of comfort from the sub.	25
‚ÄúI thought I was suppose to love 2018 wtf‚Äù	18
Where the f are you going to school that you are hearing such remarks semi regularly? That's horrible!	2
We all know that everyone was doing the Kiki do you love me ironically so that if people do it unironically then we can make fun of them.	1
Do you orgasm when you‚Äôre on your own? Are you a virgin?	7
Srsly, mountains in Netherlands?	7
They have my favorite reality shows too like Hell‚Äôs Kitchen and Survivor.	13
I love when people make proclamations without backing any of it up with examples or proof.	18
Then spend already! Go get [NAME] and [NAME] and [NAME]. Bring up that young talent and dominate already.	20
I used them too, did a great job but they were super expensive.	0
I dont know why people are hating this so much. I guess everyone here wants to be just ok for the next 5 years	6
I needed this laugh like... damn. This comment is just as good as the OP and the OP is pretty amazing. üôå	8
According to the filmmakers, it was the same Brachiosaurus that awed the characters in the first movie. ;_;	26
Oh, it's that time for you. Sending hugs. 	13

U R quite welcome buddy. Enjoy the rest of your weekend.	5
If someone starts that, I‚Äôll join in. Their mods help perpetuate it all.	4
Love in a way is a choice. In a relationship, you choose to look past your partner's faults	4

That was such awful bandaid application. Like what the fuck.	3
We got heated toilet seats here in Japan. Big smiles.	1
That was the point of his last two sentences	22
I'm surprised not to see whining about [NAME] books more often, speaking of children.	26
Can we get actual delivery dogs? I feel like that would be so much better... =D	7
[NAME] these things were terrible. i presume they still are. #teamlemoncreams	11
[NAME] Housekeeper is really funny lol	1
Yeah usually I‚Äôm defensive around people I don‚Äôt know casually walking around with things that could be powerful weapons.	4
That makes a lot of sense. I appreciate you taking the time.	0
lol I hope no-one bothers to answer you in earnest honesty because you are so childish it'll just wash right over your ears.	20
Why are you even visiting /r/Artifact if you hate the game so much?	6

I feel you! Sending love and support	5
I don‚Äôt think that many people really thought [NAME] would be a game changer.	10

Welcome to adulthood my bro.	15
I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through the hurt, this shit sucks so bad.. I don‚Äôt wish this upon anyone..	24
yeah see some of us come from youtube it's a horrible place never go there	14
Such a disappointment. Mobile games are such a shallow replacement for a full sequel. What a let down.	9
Why did a vision of my future include a story about [NAME] and [NAME] gold?	7
I love it when they show tons of interest. Love it.	18
Broke and jealous	25
What‚Äôd he say?? I want to be in on his shame!	7
Sometimes I just go on the YouTube video for any song older than like 20 years and these comments never disappoint	17
You didn't disappoint. I'm proud of you.	0
Too bad they lost.	9
It only gets worse kiddo. Someone call [NAME] and get this girl an upgrade.	11
toy has lost its value	25
The sky is actually annoying and so on (and as annoying as it makes sense. No, this is interesting how?	3
Eh, loser. It‚Äôs sad how some people don‚Äôt care about their relatives.	25
By taking it as a nonserious game you don't need in order to enjoy and have fun with it.	10
Happy real life cake day my dude :)	13
I'd say its higher tier stupidity because this belief actually harms people	10
Ugh I am in this same place right now. Dating a husband whose wife calls all the shots. I feel for you.	25
I sold an item on ebay and amazon at the same time. I had to cancel the Amazon order. Is that going to hurt anything?	7
Well, I knew that a lot of people don't trim their bushes in the eastern suburbs, but that's ridiculous.	11

[NAME] AND PORZINGOD UNDER THE TUTILAGE OF DADDY DIRK PINCH ME I MUST BE DREAMING	6
Orange man funny but concerning	1
Too bad it wasn‚Äôt a sword.	9
Funny. He said the same thing to me. I don‚Äôt even have a daughter.	17
Nice, i have the crown help me and the 309. Can you compare it to those?	7
Exactly, I've seen some of her friends and family SM and is not exactly wowing me. 	9
Sorry but the majority of console players will agree that he needs nerfed and nerfed hard	24
Why am I excited for the new season	13
[NAME] book? What the heck?!	6
Nokias can even connect to a fax machine? TIL	7
I‚Äôm so happy for them. I hope he drowns in a puddle of bacon grease.	17
I ate meat for 21 years of my life, been vegan for 7 now. This doesn't hold water.	10
She probably just said it because it rhymes, sorry Op	24
[NAME] I HATE those.	2
Seriously? Never knew... but yea that would make sense	7
Sorry to hear that. Hope you feel better soon!	20
Im desperately hoping that that is either sarcasm or a troll.	20
Yeah I remember when they banned bathrooms, crazy thing. 	22
You can't buy a toe line.	10
Welcome back, [NAME]	17
I hope she figures out he isn‚Äôt before anything happens. The entitlement herre is just over the roof	20
Beautiful yet sad that his relationship ended in ‚Äò45 the same way most of mine do...with cheating	25
At least my suffering is over.	23
It was the worst cinemax porn I've ever seen.	11
Yep, it was faked. Too bad, too	9

I'm appalled that your roommate straight up destroyed perfectly good leftovers that way	2
Pareto principle, 20% of the work done gets you 80% results.	4
Given [NAME] viability prior to the 2016 election, I think the viability bar is set pretty damn low.	9
Yikes, what a loony bird.	3
Thanks a [NAME]	15
Because its the internet and people are bored. Its not kids, its full grown adults and you know it. Unbunch your panties.	10
There was a time I said the same thing about Zucker. Hope there's something to that.	20
Not surprising since about 85% of all dating relationships end in a break up.	25
Did either of those places declare independence out of the blue? No.	6

"I didn't know that kind of ""full-tang"" existed. Good to know. "	20
Bringing it up now because you and many like you made this sub a hostile environment for voices of reason. Eat crow.	3

Is there much of a population? I wanted to play it back in The day and then they changed it into an almost entirely new game.	7
I very much appreciate it.	0
As a [NAME], this very relatable	4
Trouser maidens üòÇ omg I love it.	18

I wanna see [NAME] get in [NAME] face like this	8
Air traffic controllers are responsible for 100,000x the amount of lives. Should they be getting paid more? I'm not sure this is the best argument to make. 	6
Yeah, people die in civil wars. Stop.acting like the [NAME] are just killing [NAME] while spouting made up numbers	2
Mmm ... Chicken milk.	13

Can‚Äôt wait to see my IG page blow up with it smh	7
Sorry to say OP but it seems his IQ is indeed higher than yours.	25
I actually did have a girl a few towns away in a different school and no one knew her. No one believed me at first :(	9
Wow. In real time we have it in action. You lack any degree of self awareness.	13
Points. I envy your luck! My matches generally range from 10k-29k :/	8
I am so relieved	23
There's also the possibility of mold growing between the skin flaps. That's why some very pbese people can smell like rotting cloth.	4

Ok this actually happened to me when I was one bloodthirsty away from getting gold on my MX9	22
That's right nearby. Thanks!	15
But hey, at least it saves us the trouble of contacting them!	23
Thanks that's very helpful because I can't seem to decifer all of the levels of irony in some posts on this subreddit haha.	15
Literally all I wanted was some sort of evidence and somehow I‚Äôm wrong...? You‚Äôre too stupid to be real.	3
Japan shouldn't have attacked the USA.	10

"I'm more worried about him scamming children than ""oNLY"" scamming them into thinking they'll get $100."	14
Worrying what other people think is what collectivists have brainwashed you to think and feel. You are just a coward making excuses for your cowardice.	19

Who‚Äôs vid is This?	7
Can't help but feel that going down 3-0 is nerves and fear of playing someone with [NAME] mythology. AO to [NAME] is like RG to [NAME]	14
That's awful. But I am proud of you for calling him out.	11

THIS is a good reply, and I have kids.	0
Poor [NAME]. One of the great men of our time getting destroyed by the courts. I hear he has to file for bankruptcy.	25

I'm too stupid to understand what you're saying	3
Understand their point of view, 13 IS too young. Imagine how they felt when they found out their innocent child was watching adult videos.	12
Which part of what I wrote sounds like a baseless claim? Could you clarify me, please?	3
It's an unfortunate situation, but it had to be done at some point.	20
Of course. I'm curious as to why you'd think it was a bad sign?	7
Oh yeah, it's really dehumanizing to have respect for people's private property and not steal it from them whenever we feel like it...	3

Don't forget the part where [NAME] doubts himself or goes off on his own and fails. Then [NAME] tells him how much she loves him and to run	5

You poor, hideous creature. 	11
Love how they all claim no one pays any attention to the comments then acknowledge a comment section personality.	18

I'm polish too. I love my family but I would never even consider trying to live there trying to be happy.	18
It was pretty heart breaking, then the council came out and said they weren't going to collect them. Made a lot of people mad. 	25
Credit where credit is due.	6
Oh man, sorry to hear you‚Äôre feeling so alone. I‚Äôm feeling the same right now. 	12
"simply reply ""no."" sometimes youve gotta be rude."	10
I hate people who have the blinders on when it is one of their friends	11
That's literally insane considering we're talking about [NAME] and [NAME].	3
Yeah, well your just jealous that you don't have a cunt like me.	9
Thank you [NAME] master	15

Whoa I'm impressed he returned the pillow to its original spot. Awesome parenting.	0
He most likely saw you and just didn‚Äôt care. Sadly.	25
His head bounced on the hardwood. Damn.	25
Vancouver is even more ridiculous.	11
My DVR did the same thing as yours Damn them.	3
If this is the original Thai (I think) one then I would say it was a pretty good watch. Haven‚Äôt watched any other versions	0
You mean, their gender. And no, we really just do as much as cis person.	10
Gotta love [NAME].	18

Downvoted before I realized what sub I was on	10
this study is bull but only cos my waist is just 2 inches larger than my head and im still dumb as hell	3
I come to this sub to see cool things lol. For me it's a better version of /r/pics	1
Yes my mother is ok with it.	4
He only said that to piss [NAME] off because he wanted her to kill him and put him out of his misery. He‚Äôs a good guy.	0
Gets right back on his phone call. I like it. Must‚Äôve been one important booty call.	0
Guys help I can‚Äôt stop playing it, my hands are in so much pain!	25
What a catch, that's how you win championship games there. Wow.	0
I take care of my kids!	5
From the South and can confirm that [NAME] is an idiot and should be saying brink.	3
You hang your head in shame. Not because of this, but just in general.	12
Am I dense or is that not funny either?	6
This is true, but he's perceived as white by most liberals. 	4
There is always the risk of a team throwing him a stupid offer sheet. I still wish we would've thrown a max at [NAME].	8
Good tips!	0
Wow! There's no reason for this comment!	26

As long as [NAME] isn't suggesting [NAME] to the Lakers I'm ok with pretty much any Ringer rumor	4
I know. And it's very selfish of me to say, but I just wish it was different people that cared.	8
Is the Queen movie bad? That makes me sad. I'm still watch it anyway.	25
Idk if I want [NAME] back but I agree with [NAME] ONLY if he keeps playing at this level by the end of he season.	6
this is epic satire, too bad its close to much of what the right unironically believes	0
One need not spend much time in the justice system to understand that this remains very much a real possibility in 2019.	22
I wish I could believe in myself	8
Haha yeah, apparently their ringleader just got banned on Twitter. 	17
Let's hope he doesn't change his mind.	20
According to them, it's perfectly acceptable to have intimacy with a woman and then ghost/block her number. Lol.	1
100% agreed. If wanting people to understand the meaning of my comment makes me a coward, then I don't wanna be fucking brave.	4
Whoops! My mistake	12
Oops, just kidding [NAME], got you.	1
I was so sad when they took SG1 off of Netflix. I guess it‚Äôs on Prime now? I need to rewatch that show.	25
Aww, look at you still wearing your hospital bracelets even. 	1
Trust me, if its a person you have feelings for and she/ he just wants your body, thats really painful.	25
The only excuse for folding there pre is timing out. Ever. (I really hope that's what happened)	8
No I actually really like that I don‚Äôt have to pump my own gas.	4
The idea of that sucks!	3
This is the correct answer. I've seen more stupid memes about this show before I'd even seen it.	4
Keep trying! :) I‚Äôve just had a look and enjoyed the ones of yours I read.	0
Hey fellow conservative, you seem concerned. 	5
You're a good man, [NAME]	0

She might be hungry too since she didn‚Äôt lose her head ... feed that skinny thang	5

The only thing better than winning for a Vikings fan is reveling in the losses of our enemies.	4
This would be boring as hell	3
thank [NAME] it was returned	15
Wouldn't it be great if [NAME] went down with charges?	7
Oh fuck off already.	2
He has been horrible in pull up situations but not horrible with catch and shoot this season.	3
Poor cat got his ass kicked by a crab, rope and broom.	25
It looks like Marvin the Martian's ship. I'm still geeked as hell though. Also glad they provided a space suit for scale.	13
THAT DOES IT!	4
You're simply suggesting betrayal in a different form.	3
Holy fuck that stop, good shit [NAME]	2

Surely you've read this sub's rules. Come on, man.	4
I was thinking the same and was relieved when I read peed on kitchen floor!	23
Why? im not familar with the situation. This is the best Nebraska team in decades from what i can see	6
what the fuck	2
Woah, cool!	26
Why have you linked a random wiki article? I don't understand your point? What are you trying to claim?	6
Yes, and you must be a loonbag. 	4
I‚Äôm sorry there was trouble, but I‚Äôm glad it ended as okay as it did.	15
Thanks! Clearly I am new to reddit. Thx!	15
That's interesting I can definitely relate. I ask going to ask if people are cis too but I didn't wanna confound gender with sexuality	4
Enjoy spending yours oblivious and phony, slowly realizing as time progresses how very wrong you are. 	22
There is a difference, because unless something had given them encouragement, they'd still be feeling negative about it. 	10
i've never been baby crazy but goddamn if i'm not always craving an adorable puppy in my arms üò≠üò≠	10
Our majestic space ship!	0
This is alright, but [NAME] deserves a higher rating	0
Definitely not. It would be so boring to have no chance year after year.	10
Wise words :) she is quite remarkable in so many ways. I guess that I will just see or won't see :D	0
Hugs hugs hugs. So many big hugs and good vibes. That's the only thing I know how to say right now.	17
Thank you for the kind words :)	15
He really would be. It's not even an abortion anymore!;It's just post-birth killing!	11
When you feel nervousness, tell yourself it's just excitement. Makes a world of difference. :)	5
I understand completely. People have no memory or understanding of the true horror of these diseases. I am truly glad you have decided to vaccinate. Blessings [NAME]	15
Don‚Äôt worry about the baby but yes worry about your mom...	5
>hasn't been any form of arrested development Well fuck	2
Sure but what are you basing that off of? If [NAME] is the best jump-ball receiver, wouldn't that make him the best red zone receiver?	6
amendments are allowed on monday to mays deal, i'd be amazed if no one kills her deal	26
Happy Birthday!	13
agree with the messaging but such a cringe video	4
You're the biggest sack of shit to post here in some time.	9

I‚Äôm embarrassed how long it took for me to figure this out. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è	12
I'm most excited, honestly, for the new batches of eastern coral antivenom.	13
I really want to see the paw prints.	7
There's those people that compliment me all the time and you can tell it's so forced and fake and I honestly dont know what to say	3
I'll think about prime, just heard a lot of negative about them that spooks me some.	9
Have you been to the doctor to get checked out? Could be low thyroid.	7
Except... that's exactly what I was taught in [RELIGION] school. One god, theee aspects.	4
Sorry, didn't know where else to put it	24
I actually rooted for you guys that Seahawks game, but now I feel the true pain. 	25
Yeah after an hour he started walking and eating. But for now he‚Äôs staying inside my home for the week	22
Thank you for this	15
This seems like a colossally unimportant thing to sign a petition over.	10
I love this sub reddit üòçüòÇ	18
I understand that there are issues. However, if someone chose to stay away from Perth due to the violent behaviour then where would they go on holiday?	6
You shouldn't skip to any scene. This is a masterpiece from start to finish.	0
thats terrifying. how can people do that to their own citizens?	14
Stupid sexy squidward	2
Oh right. I can probably google it. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs in horrible taste, but I‚Äôm like dying to know now	7
Interesting. I‚Äôm not a troll.But if it makes you feel better...	5
Not a doctor but I don‚Äôt think so. Carbon monoxide displaces oxygen, but it doesn‚Äôt destroy lung tissue that i know of. 	10
Thanks for this. I was about to relapse but am still going strong.	15
We‚Äôve done this twice, we have four awesome trees from them. Awesome organization!	0
Literally nothing. Every single thing on my body is ugly. I'm not exaggerating or imagining things.	3
Came here to say exactly this. It's almost the same scene, as if he tried to recreate it	10
Last event went well, 40+ signups. Looking forward to some new faces this time. Special surprise for the winner!	26
That's gonna be a no from me dawg	10
This is the most scary [NAME] can ever be to me, cause it‚Äôs also the most real he could ever be üòÇ	14
Well it looks like I am going to spend at least a year renting to check the city out	22
They didn‚Äôt take it; you abandoned it. A TSA agent clarified that for me once. I hope you can replace it easily.	20
"i dont think theyre planning beyond ""screw over them liberal educators that are ruining our children with their sjw bullshit"" themed rants"	3
Part of being an adult is putting awkward on the back burner because some things are more important and need to be said.	4
Then you should probably get out more.	20
"Even worse: ""Share something interesting about yourself."" Suddenly I become the most boring person ever to exist."	22
In that case... Happy Amnesia Day!	13
I'm 58, my 40 year wife is 59, and my handfasted wife is 64. I'm so in love with both of them!	18
Would the state be effected by the federal shut down? I‚Äôm not sure how far reaching the shut down is.	6

Sorry, yes they do. [NAME] is the worst QB mentioned in that list.	10
I HAVE EYE PROBLEMS NOW IM REALLY YELLING	25
I'm happy to hear all that.	17
Some people have no shame or sense of self-worth. It‚Äôs sad.	25
Clearly there is only one way to solve this dilemma; COMMUNISM!	4
[NAME]! Get a DAMN good lawyer! Glad you're okay.	3

Yeah I switched to maining NM in 6 as well and it was the exact wrong game to do that lol	1
We're in it... and now [NAME] is going to the bench? Gotta good feeling!	17
Heart breaking* sorry haha	24
Well I get annoyed when they dont, because I'm always the one to answer within 30 seconds.	3
This is a genuinely good point. It‚Äôs enough to take me from giving zero shits to giving a modest shit against them.	4
Lol I‚Äôm just fucking around I can wait	3

I am so excited for tonight's episode! It's barely even started *_*	13
Lol, some guntards stepped out of the echo chamber and sounded completely unhinged.	1
I like Sao very much, bit not because of the game setting, for other reasons. The game itself sucks, tbh.	18
It's alright. This is just an unpleasant memory now. Kind of rude of your brother though!	4
Bless your dog!	5
I've done that in the past. It means he's stupid drunk and is missing you at the moment.	2
Why are you assuming the guy will be locked up? What terrorists have we released from prison?	7
Who cares? I like fat people's opinions there.	7
"The movie with crispy Lord [NAME]. ""Good Evening, [NAME]."""	15
This guys still alive?	6
"Love him! ""Thank You God"" is one of my favorites of his."	18
Damn this kid and her fancy clothes makes me feel like a bad parent.	3
Fantastic read, thanks for the insights! 	15
I can safely and honestly attest that I have had *nothing* to do with any disappearances of any sort. ~~[NAME] has already touched the reply button.~~	4
This is a solid list, and I will totally allow Scream to count. Surprised to see 10 Things below She's All That tho.	26
The kidd series is by far my favorite. Much more lighthearted than the prey books.	0
Hahaha how old are your sons? They're mixin' batches with your body wash hahaha	1
Too cute for me. Why cant i have a boyfriend *[NAME]*	18
It took me a moment but it was unexpected and got a laugh	1
I wish your mom had used the stick on his mom and explained that she has to be allowed to do it because otherwise she'd cry.	8
THANK YOU [NAME]	15
Very true. Having a 3rd pair of [NAME] and [NAME] has been solid	4
its becoming increasingly concerning that you refer to yourself in the plural.	5
Do you have anything special you say to yourself to help facilitate that? I think I might need a snappy mantra to remind myself to chill out.	7
Make the fro bigger, and it will be a perfect master piece. Rating 9.9 out of 10	0
Dudes never show any interest in me irl so I was just thinking about getting a Tinder. Seems like people have much lower standards on there so fuck it	9
I feel you, names are the worst. 	11
I was gonna report for hate but then I realized...	22
That looks so awesome	0
While you were listening to [NAME] he was idolizing [NAME].	0
Thats true. Those kinds of drinks can give you a heart attack.	4
that is not true. I often shoot the rifle round the blast 2 shots from the double barrel. Unless it got changed recently.	10
I hope this doesn't means we won't get to see [NAME] as playable god.	20
Yay! Smug buddies!	13
i love his face for that split second after he is hit	18
Da‚Äôts a beauty. Got sniped at auction with seconds left to lose [NAME] from this summer.	0

I kill him before he kills me during the date	2
Love the flower, and hope you feel better!	18
You should probably use that time to make a decent argument not the other thread then, I'm just going to leave you here .	5
6% of [NAME] is [NAME] so it wouldn't be a shock if he was of this community.	4
Don't even bother with him lol. He's a mindless sexist, doesn't believe facts at all lmao	1
Oh jeez, just took back my upvote I gave this photo. Thanks for telling us, that's extremely messed up	15
I‚Äôve missed my sweet prince	18
Why should I care what he thinks?	3
He's not an ugly guy, but 8 is too high. He's between 5-6.	4
Far from it. Name me one player that's ever left NY that we wanted to retain. I'll wait.	8

He is just awful enough to do something like that.	11
[NAME] would be an exciting guy to bring here. I think he'd at some help at RB, especially if [NAME] ain't interested	13
Time for a courageous conversation!	13
[NAME] at least has a pretty face and great skin. [NAME] looks like a cabbage patch kid.	0
The design was interesting. But it had a lot of flaws	0

[NAME] gave me depression because had I been left unchecked I would have bested him in hand to hand combat by age 16	9
I woke up drunk and mouthy	11

And then get frustrated when they realize the internet isn't censored and then call for censorship.	3
ha, hardly. maybe the biggest city. Russia is fucking huge.	4
I could see that nobody wants to be called ignorant. I also learned about the fallacy from [NAME].	4

[NAME] is having a visible affect on his game and I love it. I think we are witnessing the development of a future star.	18
Apologies but what movie is this from?	7
162 Again, for the 7th straight year. Like usual lol	1
And they wonder why they don't seem trustworthy. Maybe someone should tweet about it and they'd notice.	26
You gotta block the name out, sweets.	9
It's uncanny	26
True. But that is one out of many.	4
Turgeon offense at it's finest. The ball never gets past the three point line and [NAME] just hits a three in someone's face.	4
Good luck! The life ahead of you holds 1000% more promise than the one you are leaving behind. They caused this ... not you.	15
Fair enough haha	1
Yeah I meant it has a cork in it. Sorry for the confusion haha	1
oh, he was in the bathroom, they forgot to count him	22
Ok thank you	15
all the more reason to not give a fuck about CFF	2
What a political whore Uncle [NAME] is!	2
I hate having to take my shoes off!	2
Out of curiosity, what do you see in Verdugo that gets you to legendary?	7
Look at the size of those shorts!	26
This is the single dumbest defense out there for aim assist. This shit is just retarded.	3
I'd be extremely shocked if we don't get [NAME]. As for [NAME], I don't know much about him	26
Hell yes!	13
I wish I could come up with a bad cat joke in response to that.	8
"I just want to note that ""Live Photo"" is something how I'd expect [NAME] describe a video."	8
I know the feeling, but you‚Äôre not disgusting. Happy new year!	13
I‚Äôm stuck at work tonight so I missed it üò¢üò¢	25
When I was her age I had 3 jobs... oh you have like 18... get off my lawn!	2
are you speaking from experience?	7
I always hope that a woman will ask me out...next time it happens will be the first.	20
It's understandable to be in so much pain and agony after losing a child. If I may ask, was this your first baby?	7
Wish you the best of luck and greener pastures!	5
I don‚Äôt see anything awful on her. She‚Äôs old. That‚Äôs it.	10
Lol valid question, but yes. We've been using the bf and gf terminology for about 5 months.	1
So excited!! Probably gonna be my new main ‚öîÔ∏èüõ°	13
Oh! That explains why your teeth look like they‚Äôre covered by something haha	1
That's a pretty cat. It would be nice if it could go to Rocky Mountain Feline Rescue, as they are no-kill.	0
when was the last time our PP was good	7
That explains it, I rarely report people anymore This Khajit informs the other Khajit that it is welcome	15
Would love to share this on twitt and FB ...	18
[NAME] had a great idea about this problem actually	0
The part that shocks me is that they allowed him to wear shorts in regular class.	26
He wasn‚Äôt just a good boye He was the bestest	0
JACKPOT!!!	13
Big thanks to OP for that magnificent wall. I guess that we can reopen the government now.	15
"I love when that happens. I call it ""butt cuddles"" and we do it all the time lol!"	1

And what‚Äôs your thoughts on that specific scenario? Now I‚Äôm curious.	7
Lol you got us there hahahahahaha way cheaper too	1
Your wife is very lucky to have you. I hope my WS feels like this one day. I pray for it every night.	8
My friend is watching Grey's for the first time and she also got to this episode late last week. Weird.	7
Typo...RBG lol	1
It does IMO, I like being proud of India and I can not be proud if [NAME] wins.	20
Yawning at the insults to me, not the Woman	3
> But you will probably find you are noticeably worse looking at 40 than you are at 27. Well that's disappointing.	9
Is that why you stayed so long? :P	6
I live in Baltimore and heard she will have an office out of here. Any details on how I can volunteer for her campaign?	7
I feel like that‚Äôs not the best spot for a beach	10
Why do you want it to be the world's leader and savior, outta broken and needs some alone time. 	7
I waited 15 days for this joke, I'm so proud of this community.	21
"I love you guys but.....""existence"""	18
I love the thumbnail dude, but I‚Äôm already Soldier	18
Yeah, my schedule has been brutal for the past 2-3 years. This year it has become my objective to get more involved to get-in with more parents.	4
I mean I guess your prostate is healthy right?	6
didn‚Äôt know [NAME] was still alive	26
Yeah some kid in a BMW ran me off the road. I didnt just crash had some help.	19
The [NAME] of horror!	14
It isn‚Äôt that bad :/	4
There was nothing innovating lol. It was good but chill	1
Great job! Hats off to you.	0
Must not have been the [NAME] of his day... But seriously though i hope he's alright..	5
It's likely that they don't have much, yet still make poor financial decisions.	9
"Weird how ive been ""attempted"" the same scam twice and im just a nobody.. Probably more or less amatur x'D"	12
Ah, didn‚Äôt know that but can‚Äôt blame him. Thanks!	15
If they rig the DNC once, they can do it again.	4
I think some idiotic members are extremist, but for the most part they just hate mass unchecked immigration.	3
[NAME] looked great!	0
This is something that's not brought up enough.	22
Rule number 1: never dye your hair while drunk haha	1
It's unrelated to the post yet I'm laughing out loud	1
The Citadel has given us much to be thankful for.	15
[NAME] is such a pretty lady. I'm jealous of those huge eyes!	0
Oh that's actually really interesting. So IQ of the general population would be a bell curve by definition?	7
This is really great!!	0
I love rational comments.	18
Lol! Too funny. Mine are depressed, they gave up. :(	1
Wow, again? You deleted and reposted it after I called you out not even 5 minutes ago! #desperate	22

There are too many depressing headlines on the news. This story made me laugh.	1

We were playing bots for 30 mins... Not fun but i am happy i finally did it	17
that was clearly only one pump, bad call	9
He already has 2 fouls	4
will do, thanks	15
Love this!!!	18
I believe if he did (and she didn‚Äôt) then he SHOULD be in even more trouble. They can easily fact check that.	4
Is it bad that I would actually probably buy that? Those come in handy for defrosting windows.	6
This is the game that finally lost my faith.	9
If you're more concerned about a potential person than an actual person, you should get out of medicine. You aren't qualified.	3
Looks weirdly fake Edit: turns out it‚Äôs real	26
I like that that guy didn't make a snarky remark in 2015 because he was upset that another MP was sitting in his usual seat.	18
Need some new prog material, I'm stoked to listen to it!	13
My faith in humanity is restored. Your good deed has been noted on the Big Board of Doing Nice Things.	0
You can't freely make a decision when your opinions are a shitty contract or life on the streets. That is not freedom.	10
The fact that this statement got downvoted shows how worthless some people on here are.	11
Because I want to be with someone but no one wants to be with me.	25
The famous tank man. We know close to nothing about him. So I rather preferred to think he is living his life peacefully.	0
"They had been chanting ""we want tacos!"" Lol"	1
Thanks for the advice man ! Have a great New Year‚Äôs Eve	15
Why is it dumb? It's not like once people get married they believe in a society that looks down on premarital sex. Maybe you missed my point.	6
I feel your pain...	25
Can't believe this game actually released in the state it's in complete joke , should be criminal	10
oh my [NAME] is this real	26
You're in for a treat- enjoy :)	17
unplanned pregnancy != rape Not commenting on the beings involved in the story up above, but seriously those two things are not equivalent	10
lol, thank u. i might just not be the smartest, always possible	1
> The parents don‚Äôt parent anymore. I am sure this fact is well referenced in [NAME] new curriculum.	4
Wait so you can get an acre of rainforest for $35? I mean, it would be way cheaper at that volume but still that's real cheap	26
You his SO?	6
I'd be able to give you more helpful advice if you could be a little more clear with your situation and what you're asking.	5
[NAME] is legit! Loving this move.	18
This is a long shot here, but do you think we could eventually edit genes to produce longer life spans? Or maybe to stay younger for awhile?	7
This makes so much sense. Seems she has been icing me. Time to call it quits	22
Such a hilarious way to put it, and omg yup.	1
No they don't.	10

As a fellow shuffle/jamskater this makes me really happy lol.	1
Spending my first day ever in Europe. In Oslo, with an amazing girl I met visiting Texas from Norway about a year ago. 	17
Lucky, when I did it my nickname ended up being [NAME]	17
That was what our media guys said but he is now 1/3 in the shootout (was 1/2). No clue how they butchered that one so badly.	6
And I laughed	17
yep i don't know how are aren't up	6
Great thanks! Just wanted to be prepared in case of OT or something	15
The TV anime series is, at least, atrociously bad and stupid. Is full of deus ex and silly cliffhangers.	9
But you clearly agree with most or some of his ideas, do you not?	7
hey uhhhh I love you	18
Wow, how did a kid manage to eat a whole watermelon over the space of 47 hours!	26
Looks gorgeous on u üòçüòç	0
While this makes me happy to know, it would probably be for the best if we didn't post these things where abusers can find out about them.	17
Cheers!!	17
My tongue is still a little scorched lol. But totally worth it	1
[NAME] was the [NAME] of the [NAME] years. Didn't realise he was still about.	22
This honestly explains so much. Thanks for some insight into myself lol	15
Fuck you, tincan. *reads username* Wait ignore the tin can part, fuck *specifically you* in general. 	2
Your comments are nothing but rhetorical ways of telling me I'm wrong. Zero substance.	10
wow i watch the video fews time and I'm still amazed	0
What are the sequels called? Loved Infernal Affairs	18
This is painful	25
You'd think people who have this high an opinion of themselves would be more open to taking advice on how to beat certain matchups. Enjoy being a scrub.	17
Thank you! I‚Äôll give it a listen tonightüòä	15
Lol, nice try. 	1
No more like he took away their talking point about paying federal workers. Lol salty downvote	1
Thank you that‚Äôs sweet of you (:	15

What‚Äôs all this [NAME] business? Edit: Thanks for the info below everyone üòá	7
I have a shirt with a picture that is very similar to this	22
 Don't be so stupid. Terrorism is inherently political, religion is just one of the tools used to carry it out. 	10
this is great TV. I want to see her do this on Legends	0
Or the long con. My Dad guilted me into taking care of my Grandmother for her.	3
Ugh yeah it‚Äôs really tiring. I‚Äôm in a public place right now and just had like, 3 mood swings. 	3
WHAT THE FUCK	2
Shared misery *always* makes me feel better :D	17
I like were ur head is.	18
Man, and I thought the princess and the toad was an odd story	11
Interesting. Are there any studies that show that it‚Äôs not natural for humans?	7
Yeah it‚Äôs not a fatal error, hopefully [NAME] and [NAME] can stay healthy next year and hit that milestone or at least flirt close to it. 	20
‚ÄúWe only let him jump around for 12 hours a day!‚Äù Wow. I‚Äôm so sorry this is happening to you.	24
üò≠I appreciate the feedback <3	0
That's what I say, but the commercial is clearly pandering.	4
Awe! That sucks!	2
OK name it. It will help. As for as merc is concerned, no worries reached tier one already	5
When asked about my hopes for the Wild, i always (half) jokingly say, ‚Äúi hope my grandkids can see them raise their first Cup‚Äù	20
We, the fans, are the losers here.	25
Damn dude, can‚Äôt believe I never considered this possibility.	26
Thanks bro!	15
I think we'll find out how apt this comparison is within the next few years.	20
Yep. First Monday of 2019.	13

Thank you for the advice!	15
Do you have proof for what you said scientifically and mathematically ?	7
This is amazing.	0
I‚Äôve just said that both biology and social norms play a part? How is that me saying that there are no biological differences?	7
Someone on r/nba said [NAME] was borderline elite defensively...lol	1
Death treats are for immature people, I'm sorry you received them. Comparing you to flat earthers is not far off though.	25
Non-stop fun.	1
I was just quoting the president (through his press secretary) to be honest.	8
could you live upstate? Maybe take the truck home with you and live close to the pick up terminal?	7
[NAME], I had. It *was* a repressed memory, thanks.	15
Don't forget the awkward tomboys.	11
This was posted at the exact same time as another guy posted it on here, and that scares me.	14
I don't understand our immigration restrictions. It's not like we don't have room up here	3
28 weeks!!?! modern medicine is AMAZING!	0
I am starting to get very concerned with [NAME] and [NAME]	5
Once a week. It was a semi expensive seafood place, but it also had a poppin sports bar/happy hour vibe. An interesting place for sure 	17
Thank you very much. I try my best to follow my steps from therapy, but it seems to be my biggest hurdle.	15
You‚Äôre the meme this sub jokes about.	1
[NAME] you sound like my father, I feel sorry for you	24
Interesting, I haven't actually heard of an app that does that. Makes no sense to me, even with serious memory issues.	0
Nobody is shaming them for trying to stop article 13. Youtube is being shamed for being hypocrites.	12
I love bloodborne, I started my second play through but quit after I got busy with school stuff.. need to go back to it though.. love that game 	18
Man that dude seems to be having a blast at the character select screen. I'm so hyped, where do I sign up?	6
I have an honest question for you sir. Wouldn't a person who went through that hell be more humble and understanding than someone who didn't?	7
April 2018‚Äì so this sub is now all about finding the outrage needles in the haystack, eh? 	7
Yea idk what to tell ya man sorry. Not sure why it‚Äôs doing that	24
WHAT?! You dare insult the band of gods?! Typical teen, I hate my own generation! *screams in 16 year old*	2
Beer bottles and his ex's old stuff. Because if country music has taught me anything its that all that exists is a gun, alchohol and some girl you lost. 	22
I am so terribly sorry you lost your dad to this horrendous disease. Judging by this photo, he had a terrific smile.	16
I love CoD4	18

"I stoped telling story because ''[NAME]""*. Drawing makes me look intensely people to measure their ratio and understand their shapes. That's my new fun"	17

I feel shot in the heart.	25
Yeah, I read that the first time. Nobody is forcing you, other than yourself.	4
So I heard. How is she, haven't seen her in a while.	7
I am extremely excited to read this.	13
What a great shitpost. How did he even come up with this	0
Sounds like your location overall sucks. Have you ever thought about getting a work visa elsewhere with a more accepting attitude?	4
I went to high school with [NAME], never would have thought he‚Äôd be an isles fan lol	1
I know from personal experience that that can be the end of any good relationship.	4
Why can't I get Hulu in Canada yet!! So annoying	3
Yup, I'm sick with a mild cold	4
I was responding to the title of the post (not the article). Did you call OP racist? I‚Äôm guessing not.	6
But OP said her life is ruined because 'muricans are bad.	11
It's better with sound, when I first watched it I cried laughing for 10 mins	1
yeah it was awesome!	0
I honestly couldn't care less if we lose or not. I'm over the moon about [NAME] and nothing could make me unhappy	9

No mercy, if there is any man left inside you than walk out now.	5
Guys who work on aircraft usually have hard time hearing. Its unavoidable.	25

Will you PM me too? I've been looking for a birthday present and I'd like to take a look at what you've got!	8
Play stupid games stamkos, win stupid prizes	3
My money is on [NAME]. Doubt [NAME] is back up next yr. [NAME] looked.good last preseason. I was surprised he didn't beat [NAME] then.	26
that was a horrible fix	14
And the players who are older than me are retiring and it looks like I might never play professional baseball.	9
That beat slaps. Good memories	17
Women don't have penises so cannot rape by the legal definition of the word. They can sexually assault however.	3
If you want to know what kind of people her parents are you can google her. He name is [NAME]	22
My god, [NAME]!	26
I read it as him taking her virginity. Raping her...unless it was consensual and she WANTED to lose it.	11
I joined DbD right after [NAME] release, but man I wish I had the splinters	8
What? The claim is 2018 best shooters. Not overall best shooters	7

So what‚Äôs the upside. Toner makes the elastic in your skin tougher? Serum for vitamin C does what? Thanks for sharing.	15
I refuse to read him any more. Just another [RELIGION] man getting a slap on the hand & a cover up job.	10
A video that makes me happy	17
[NAME] bless you	5
Feeling good in the gayborhood.	17

This made me sad	25
That live snail got me freaked	14
Then they'll have to get a ticket with a code of it from the counter person.	4
That is so beautiful. It makes my heart hurt that humans can be cruel to animals when they're aware of having so much emotion.	25
Ha ha good one	0
Cool, thanks man	15
I love that sometimes I don‚Äôt know what he says but like I vibe wit it instead	18
He sexually assaulted you. Notify the police and the staff!	5
My mom and I do the same exact thing. I hate it.	10
Really funny how our FO liked the 2 of the worst qbs. [NAME] and [NAME] That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm skeptical about our FO now	1
I've been trying to as well, but the game is so scary :/	14
"Did you guys notice that one of the headlines on the magazine from the last act said ""A real life marvel"" I loved that little detail honestly"	0
So it‚Äôs somehow weird or different to make a child/student pick up their (there) own mess as part of the lesson?	12

The worst thing about this tweet is how many likes and retweets it got	3
Are you kidding me? /r/subsithoughtifellfor	7
Done, good luck with your thing.	5
Late-stage Reddit. I'm afraid it's malignant, there are only palliative care options available at this point.	14
[NAME] has been somehow worse than [NAME] so far. Do we have any other subs who couldve played as wingers?	7
> Killing an intruder in your home in self defense is now a really bad thing. That was not even under discussion.	10
We won't. If Ireland do they'll be violating the GFA.	10
I hope [NAME] at least has a good nanny because [NAME] seems keen to scream on Instagram rather than...do anything else on the planet.	20
"Hey its you again. Dude can you please say ""N"" so I can complete the task? My last request went unanswered sadly."	25

That‚Äôs too bad, I didn‚Äôt know that.	25
Yep. There are some good things hidden in amongst the bad. It would be disingenuous to claim otherwise.	4
I thought you were just going to wait her out. You actually engineered her loss of space to someone else. WELL DONE!!!!	0

I, too, have lied about getting hooked up by Hasbro to justify the unhealthy amount of money I have spent on Nerf guns. 	4

When you've been dodging as much as [NAME] has, to this challenge, ppl start to 2nd guess and lose faith in you.	22
Holy shit. Thank you everyone. Thanks for the gold and silver :)	15
This might be my favorite scene in the whole series	18

I can feel that already, I'm already getting pain at time with it, but I can only imagine the pain after for healing.	25
Weird but interesting nonetheless.	0
You're giving her too much credit.	10
Well said.	15

I love the outfit that [NAME] is wearing	0
Ah I didn't know that. I meant this [NAME] ad:	22
Thanks dude, speaking of the Sahara thay is how dry our texting has gotten. Any tips to spark it back up?	15

Also, the phone is set to another language than the one being spoken, which is a bit weird.	3
LMAO I love hockey	18
Wasn't the scar originally across his nose but [NAME] moved it?	7
I loved that show. ‚ÄúThe [NAME] is back!‚Äù	18
I'm planning to see one, without my parents knowing though :/ I really hope it gets better. I can't seem to take it anymore. 	20

Just remember we‚Äôre all silly looking, gangly monkey things living on a rock floating through nothing, all trying to be cool. Have fun	17
Rightfully so. I had it as a child and it was the worst experience in my life. I'm also vulnerable for shingles now. Yaaay.	9
I really like him goat and [NAME] on the 4th line. They've been real solid. Absolute beauty of a first goal. Congrats, trevor.	18
Love the snow suit.	18
I just forgot that arguing with people on the internet is useless and like talking to a wall. So Im out.	22
Uh . . . Uh . . . I'm not feeling so well.	25
The first half is able to run on the momentum of being stupid fun, the second half falls apart really quick.	9
Not really, it can bind *itself* (though not future incarnations) otherwise none of the laws would mean anything.	3
After listening to the lecture, I‚Äôve concluded that there‚Äôs no way this kid isn‚Äôt a redditor	22
Sadly, that theory is plausible in the lds inc realm of thinking.	25
Mmm I dunno about that üòä but thank you	15
Shit, they don‚Äôt go down!? That blows 	9
I learned that recently driving into SLC for the first time in the rain/snow. I couldn't see shit. 1/10 Was scary.	14
I was pleasantly surprised that I couldn‚Äôt think of anything I broke at my last retail job but... you‚Äôre right, that was it	26
I'm sorry, do people NOT listen to [NAME] 9th while driving?	15
yep. I feel guilty for throwing them out but they're basically useless.	24

I fully endorse the oppression and eventual extermination of all gamers.	4
Nope, nope, nope and HELL NOPE! 	10
Maybe 2 years ago the time wasn't right for your relationship and now it is. It's been long enough to give it a second chance imo.	10
it only flatters them when they‚Äôre posed a certain way. but other than that, it looks awful and uncomfortable	11
Because it's fun?	6
Lol I wish	8
He's an adorable person.	0
Are you honestly being serious? I have a hard time believing that you can afford it	7
I think we can all agree that this is the right answer.	4
[NAME] a bastard man	2
And why do you have low self esteem?	7
And that was more or less the manager's position on it. He was obviously trying very hard not to call her stupid to her face.	22
This is probably the most realistic if we throw in a 1st, 	4
Don‚Äôt like blood of the dead by the looks of it.	10

It never came into my mind that I'm being edgy, my friend. I'm not worried.	20
Fair enough. But he‚Äôd basically become an off tank with all that healing lol. I already get raped by reaper enough (tank main)	1
I like it I just wish he‚Äôd drop the m and apostrophe	8
First impressions don't need more then a day. Not to Mention 10 raids and tons of pvp I'll be fine.	4
Yeah i miss lectures for this exact reason. Its pretty bad, but what can ya do :/	9
Anyone know how high of a fall that was? Edit: ~4 seconds of falling. .5 X 9.8 X 4^2 = ~78 feet.	7
My vote... snow will mainly be in the mountains. Good thing to help with the summer drought.	4
Surprisingly, not a lot of people know though.	26
So precious! Thanks for sharing Give me animals pics over human babies any day~	15
Back to back against Nashville and Vegas. Fuck I love this team.	18
What‚Äôs funny is these objectively corrupt sacks of shit were bitching about made up Liberal ‚Äúcorruption‚Äù.	1
I feel his pain. Bad dxm trips are the most terrifying thing in the moment but they're way more forgiving than bad psych trips	25
Not true. Our knowledge of it is derived from the fossil record, which is geological.	10
Gee I wish.	8
Never once is it implied that the birds can sense crazy people.	1
Shut the fuck up, loser.	2
Same. Wasn't good enough. Left broken. Edit: more broken	9
Ii can't believe you just said that!	26
Go buy some stand-offs. The stop the ladder from falling sideways.	22
Wow! I‚Äôve never seen so many deleted comments, and that‚Äôs saying something.	26
What about urban [NAME] supporters who are socially liberal and want to see tax dollars used efficiently?	7
Thanks, I felt underappreciated until now!	15
I am only sharing what my friends said, what their experience was. I found that a bit surprising.	26
Yeh lol. Reddit acts as if he's hitler when he doesnt even get that many views. I	1
thanks this isn‚Äôt incredibly triggering for me (and a bunch of others) or anything	15
When I harass women with innuendo and they politely deflect, they know I am right. At least that's what I told the judge. 	4
I think the flairs get removed if a team hasn't been to a major in a certain amount of time. Don't quote me on that though.	3
I didn‚Äôt know that existed. Thanks, stranger.	15

Cool! Thanks for responding! ;)	15
blocking [NAME] run ? Very bad	7
I don't generally find the CBO projections very accurate in retrospect. Some of their accounting practices and metrics seem error prone.	10
Oh yes! You're great.	0
Well that makes it easy. Thanks again. I'll look into it.	15
I unfortunately can not afford a lawyer. Luckily the only thing that we shared is our daughter	25

I loooooove Tiff!!!	18
Thanks for the gold kind stranger	15
That's not what follows from that at all.	10
How about as a whole we just hate snow	10
That sounds very sketchy to me. I would be thinking he‚Äôs with another girl TBH	3
Happy late birthday :) I hope you got to spend it with someone/doing something that makes you feel happy and whole.	20
RDR singleplayer, not whatever the fuck that online is	3
Goalpost shifting much?	7
Indescribably beautiful.	0
Yeah who knows how many indictments [NAME] is gonna rack up retroactively? It could be hundreds! /s	6

> Sleeping next to someone I knew my wife is trying to kill me!	14
No, a plot hole means that your story lacks logical consistency 	10
Not too much, I‚Äôm talking to a girl right now that‚Äôs 5 years younger than me lol.	1
Spiritual shorthand. You nailed it. That term says it all. They've become so practiced in it that it has become meaningless.	0
You might be right. Not everybody is going to find their way the same as I did.	4
They do get an awful lot of upvotes, so they seem to have at least some support from others.	0
A stunning place, you will need lots of cuddles to stay warm though!	0
Anybody think maybe we‚Äôre the mystery team in on [NAME]? At this point I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised.	7
Posting someone elses camp on reddit? Really? haha.	1
Not sure why you're trying to shove spoiler hints into the face of someone who explicitly said they just finished chapter 1 but more power to you I guess	6
Thank you! It sucks but not being a zombie is so worth it!	15
This makes me unfathomably angry.	2
Yeah. Why throw a wrench into a handy conviction?	7
So, just a super verbose tone trolling?	7
so [NAME] isn't necessarily as dumb as she literally appears... I've always liked her for some reason.	18
Can we get a moment of silence for the passing of the video game boy?	16
sorry im deaf i can‚Äôt hear you	24
I know, you see somehow the world is changing me and its so wonderful	0
I really want to know what the coordinates he gave him are	8
This is absolutely lerfect, fantastic lunchpine.	0
She doesn't have to pay anything this is just an opinion of a lawyer. No court ordered that.	10
I still think he should have been the first goalie in the 2014 World Cup. But alas that injury ruined everything.	25
> not broken I beg to differ.	10
I like flirting so this is what I enjoy doing, plus ordinary flirting is outcome independent. Direct approach is outcome dependent. Either way it's all part of the fun!	17
"I love you so much. > **""putas""** Qu√© eres mi que? (don't how can i translate it)"	18
Bidets are disgusting. In america, we use toilet paper because our plumbing systems can take it	11

Rule 2, 3, and 7. Impressive. Goodbye.	0
Thank you for this video	15
I love humans	18
the ALTERNATE caption! good thinking!	0
His base is too large to knock him off. Unless he gets impeached/indicted/god knows what, he‚Äôll probably be it (sadly). 	25
Oh you know they‚Äôre BOTH going for it.	26
I agree I think this version of pac has the biggest chance against floyd	4
Sorry for hopping on this. But anyone know of any bars in Hamburg to watch the match	7

Same director for both series, and one of the best in the business.	0

Interesting. I‚Äôm very against the death penalty.	10
yeah he was a good defender in Utah	0
Thank you :) I'll try to stay positive	15
The best, besides the hundreds of other games that are better. You know, like how Mcdonald's has the best food in the world. 	0
I also relate (and regret)	24
i agree he is pretty average but the guy i was responding him was calling him ugly which i find pretty ridiculous	4
I was trying to make the point that the patient is still having a seizure; it's just not visible because they are paralyzed.	19
I liked the magic but it's really superfluous. Dr [NAME] is literally just ironman with a bad accent, like why does this exist	4
It looks fun as hell too, from what I can tell. I‚Äôd love to give it a whirl	18
The amount of people there saying water is free is astounding. How out of touch with reality can you be?	7

Get some colloidal silver and put that in your eye so it doesn‚Äôt get infected!!!	5
For the love of [NAME] gobget the tweezers!	18
I think you're right. She has oodles of cash and young grandchildren to enjoy. Going through that hideous gauntlet again probably isn't that appealing.	17
She's cute but she's got that crazy look, the type of girl that would cut your d*ck off. üò¨	0
I have, I've always wanted to celebrate Christmas and actually have a more closer family	8
Ok thanks for your help!	15

This South Florida girl loves Jaxons Ice Cream. Seeing the kitchen sink makes me want to drive home.	18
It's great with Brave	0

I second this. All signs point towards him biding his time until the next election and hopefully solidifying his place to expunge the filth.	20
Kerastase. Redken is pretty good, too. 	0
Holy shit! No way in hell I'd get that close to DFW in a Cessna!	26
For me, I tend to (over)share with friends, but also get offended at trivial questions like you.	3

I got confused for a second and thought why would you pay for your ex's trip	6
One of the greatest moments of my life, to date	17
That was a brutal shift. Honestly he should be playing sheltered minutes. Team needs [NAME] and [NAME] back, give bulk of his minutes to [NAME]. 	3
Damn it, I only have 6 comments on this sub, I don‚Äôt qualifyüòû	9
You are the parent your grandson deserves. Your daughter will regret the pain she has caused.	24
I think 2020 will be the year it'll start to really crumble. 2019 is the year we still have to work really hard to make that happen.	20
Jfc, that's depressing.	19
That's a great idea!	0
Ask and you shall receive. Thanks man	15
Yeah sorry about that I don't mean it.	24
Me too, whenever my friends get with people I dont feel happy for them. I just feel envy and rage.	3

Thanks for sharing! I've got some smoothie recipes to start me out and the one I bought today at a local shop seemed to help a bit.	15
It is bad tho.	10
Please tell me how you feel about [NAME] and [NAME] again once you've finish with your manufactured outrage.	7

Lol, believe me you would know. 	1
They're wrong I don't like math and I'm still ugly	3
Yeah, but you get the honor back for skinning them as 'Resourceful'	4
Just as a curiosity I wonder what [NAME] would offer for someone like him in light of their desperation at forward.	7
‚ÄúRegain the fan base‚Äù. How immature do you have to be to believe that everyone agrees with you.	9
Is that how friendship works? Holy crap, I've been missing out!	7
I love CO2.... ... as carbonation in beer and soda.	18
Your nan and dad are both trash. I am so glad you were able to pull yourself up and rise above. üíï	17

Eesh, really sorry for your loss.	25
It gave me a laugh. xD	1

As much as I don‚Äôt like his splits would have liked him on that contract that‚Äôs a huge miss for the dodgers imo.	10
Okay, thanks Discord. ~~I hate it.~~	15
Interesting. Is it cool to say colored person now?	6
I wishhhh. She‚Äôs honestly what started getting me the fuck away from centrism	11

I apologised an very long time ago as I was wrong at this point you are beating a dead horse	24

You conveniently forgot nearly killing a toddler by throwing furniture out of a 14 story window.	2
Pretty sure they claimed he resisted arrest. If I remember correctly he was just peacefully sitting on the curb when the cops decided he was resisting.	10
No. It cannot. It's a dangerous fantasy (unironically)	10
it's a damn shame.	12
Ha you're hilarious. Upvoted	1
Atonement is just something else. [NAME] is just so lovely in his writing.	0

One of my favs was when we were in the playoffs against the Habs and we won all five fights in a line brawl	4
Not sure why this is sitting at -10. Thanks for your concise explanation of both sides.	15
Guess it's a good thing he cant feel them anymore	0
No. I make jokes about it, and so does he but he doesn't actually know. 	1
I would love it. I'm financially responsible and it would send me a signal that you are as well.	18

I love being down by 10+ constantly.... I feel like [NAME] gets dominated by literally everyone.	18
This is a reliable estimate. It could happen as early as in the 2020‚Äôs if were unlucky	9

Yeah it's takes some time but use all that negative energy and focus on yourself.	5
Ouch! My hear sank. Don‚Äôt do this to me.	2
Why the fuck would I post something on r/niceguys and pretend to be the woman talking shit about myself?	3
I love that he wears the rad suits. You do you Mr [NAME].	18
"And then he comes back after Wallmark's goal with, ""A little Swedish Sizzle!"" Best play-by-play announcer in the business. Love him!"	0

I wish I hada dog who is as good of a boy as him	8
Totally amazing that some peoples' egos can't even handle being honked at.	3
So good to see [NAME] back, looks like he hasn't lost a step.	17
Thank you. It feels better knowing that this is not an unheard of thing.	15
I love 4 and 5 just as much as the early seasons. You can't recapture lightning in a bottle; I'm just glad they kept at it.	18

Uncle [NAME], you dirty old man.	2
Maybe she‚Äôll think it was cute how shy you were	0
they have died here in canada	16
The subreddit has 6 subscribers but 20 online?	7
As a high libido female, I feel the same with posts from males. It's slightly relieving to know someone else struggles the same way.	23
Yeah with this and the other thread DoorDash is definitely down. Just go home and don't answer any 650 numbers	4
Even if you were a woman, your personality is so vile and yuck I would happily do 20 years in prison for murdering you.	11
Yeah I want all our players to have a nice healthy hatred for Texas. Good way to ensure they get hyped to play em.	4
Its literally bread on a bread board, whats the issue here?	7

You've added nothing to this conversation and just repeated what everybody else. Thanks for wasting my time.	3
I actually found the whole screenshot ‚Äì without cropping ‚Äì on r/funny so I mean	1
While it is unfortunate to hear that he is no longer interested, I hope that this brought some level of closure to you.	5
I love [NAME]	18
I‚Äôd rather reply to you, simply because you sound like an idiot	3
Is this [NAME] brother??	7
Youre not wrong, but that applies to every ad. People are generally getting upset with the message more than anything though	9
I would say the answer is better education, not disenfranchisement based on socioeconomic circumstances, but you do you I guess.	4
CL...let‚Äôs just hope we can stay in EL for the time being.	20
Are you serious? The entire site determines what to show you based on upvotes.	7
Sometimes, I feel bad if I don't every now and then. I mostly talk with her on SC/IG tho. 	24
Well, it wasnt by 31.... So im still mad.	2
I'll handle what ever comes my way, I adore our children. :)	18
The problem is not getting new players but keeping the current ones.	9
There are so many posts from [NAME] on here it makes me wonder what people think wholesome means.	26
Get em chief, fuck em, I find those people annoying as hell and I barely even use Instagram/twitter	3
Glad she's not living in a bubble then....	17

Does it have less scope glint than the 3x medium range scope? Or any glint at all?	6
[NAME] loves you. Be yourself and don‚Äôt let bigots stop you.	18
Wonder where all the shit is.	26
its even worse because the starter kit is like $70 too right? So in reality she probably made closer to $30	10
That's true. People feel they can't trust anything so they just chose to believe what they want to believe.	4
I love how the sun just decides its going to pull Australia from Earth and cuddle with us... If only it didn't burn so much.	18

Why do y'all gotta be mean like this. They're clearly comfortable with themselves	4
I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a better or worse reason for wearing the arm band :(	6
Any time he's passionate about something. I love seeing passionate people and 9/10 want to rip your clothes off.	18
I'm actually surprised none of his wives have stabbed him in his sleep already. Now he has secret service protection üòã	26
I haven't seen a sign like that on mine. Not that it would carry the force of law, anyway, in Florida.	26

This is what it's like to have a heart attack in the Cars universe.	22

I wanna win this game so bad FJB	8
[NAME] no, these are horrid on anyone.	14
I love this sub. Always 5% toxic, 95% thought out properly 	18
Random question but has your username ever actually worked lmao	1
So either the dog is sick or the owner has non-trivial mental illnesses.	6
I guess your ex-fiance was different huh? That's really interesting. I've never had a fiance before, personally	10

Really like Molotov, such a great song!	0
Thank you üôè	15
Wow so you've been around your entire country and spoken to every single person about traffic accidents? So cool.	0
Thank's for the notice.	15
I wasn't sure either. I'm 30 and my doctor has never said anything about getting retested or revaccinated.	6
Thank you. We literally had stopped her an hour before she made her break.	15
Uh, sorry. We're under trumpcare now.	24
Who even are you? Get off the Internet little boy. I don't have time for you	3

You need to make sure that healthy food is within convenience for the players so that they don‚Äôt end up eating 2 minute noodles every day	5
Thank you. I feel like I‚Äôve scarred her for life, but I know that‚Äôs probably not the case.	15
It was a dig at OP not you ahah, this video was posted there over a year ago	1
Curious about your thoughts on BC‚Äôs LNG activity.	7

Holy shit it's almost like the PYD is a organization of Syrian citizens I can't believe he exposed them on that.	3
She‚Äôs just overweight. I don‚Äôt see anything particularly wrong with her clothing. Lots of people dress adventurously.	4

Same. Not being hateful to the op but I don't see the connection.	2
Don't worry looking for it, there isn't any porn tab/hidden message	5
It's like you've never even been around dogs.	4
Yes, it can be a very stressful read at times.	4
I feel like I already knew, I just needed to have someone else tell me to really open up my eyes. Thank you for your comment	15
Or just simply hinting at it. All in fun though	1
Yeah, I do this too. It's almost comforting. I'm glad I'm not the only one.	4
Great documentary on that: Grandmas Boy.	0
The University of Essex was a mistake. They're not even good at sports.	10
Mark it nsfw just to mess with people. Worst title I have seen all week.	11

Good news though. Yesterday the devs were running test server during the morning.	17
But i really need you to delete the comment	8
Ahh yeah I've been there didn't know it had a name. Thanks dude.	15
Don't think so. Pretty sure i tried it on the MOG 12	10
This is so wildly specific I love it	18
I'll keep u updated man. It's only a 7eth withdrawal so hopefully it processes quickly.	20
Glad *you* find it funny!! You've ruined my morning!!	1
You‚Äôre right, no one is taking you seriously, Reddit user.	4
This is an incipient antivaxx community, I don't want to see them lobbying and increasing in numbers like in the USA or Romania	10
I‚Äôll be honest, I didn‚Äôt expect that to be real	4
Your imaginary boyfriend is kinda creepy. Although, if he's kinky then he may be for keeps. *wink 	14
That's the exact person who would buy one of those	4
Let it flow through you, become empowered by it. 	5
HOW?!	7
Women should have all the same rights as men. That does not include ending another human‚Äôs life.	4
Damn that is sexy	0
DJ finding consistency makes me happy	17
I was also [NAME]. We all make mistakes	4
She has a disorder of sorts. Not only do you both need counseling, but she needs some kind of therapy. 	5
Yep. This sub is just being overly reactionary, which surprises no one.	4
I mean, I believe even Showgirls is a better movie than TLJ at this point.	0
Unfortunately not but I loved the saxy section and would love to see it again!	13
This inspiring.	17
It‚Äôs amazing.	13
[NAME], back at it again with the awesome art.	0
Hey there, I hope you're still with us. Let's talk.	20

Seattle's train is nice... once you get there. It is an absolute hike from the terminal	0
I didnt realize wishing Liberty would open their wallet would make it happen... It sucks, but it's the reality. We need value.	3

This guy is one of the best role models for [NAME]	0
I think you grossly overestimate how many former felons will bother voting anyway, and grossly underestimate how conservative hispanics ([NAME] in particular) are in Florida.	7
(I tried to answer this in my below comment but I also just wanted to say I really love your username)	18
I remember being so excited when we got AAA back, even though it cost us Fournier...man, that sure went south. #ThanksShaw	13
I don‚Äôt go out that way much but even [NAME] is killer if it‚Äôs slippy out.	10

Shut up, Mag!	2
The third picture is creepy.	14
The website is still up. You want to see this. I've met the guy. He's super nice.	0
You must have a different definition of exciting. Ivan v Alyosha aka atheism vs [RELIGION] is very exciting.	4
Its all good until that episode where [NAME] traps the bat on [NAME] head comes on and she screams bloody murder and wakes us up.	25
I‚Äôm not attractive but thank you.	15
Lmao thanks for the update!	15
I mean I love this but I actually think the backup was better.	18
I used to enjoy it and grew out of it.	17
My husband gets very prudish anytime kids are anywhere. EVEN in our locked bedroom.	9
[NAME] absolutely embarassed Milksmith in the game we've lost against the Griz. It never would've happened if we had AD.	12
Time to let the justice system run its course.	4
She'll ask them a question, interrupt them to say that something else is coming up and then talk about something irrelevant. She is all over the place.	3
I find that telling the truth as much as possible makes things less complicated. I've learned to spin the truth when needed, though.	4
No, not at all.	10
That's cute. Sincerely Nepal, 7.6	0
Sadly, he seems immune to bans. He also dodges them with alts like [NAME]	25
One of my favorite films. I got to see a screening with a live soundtrack conducted by [NAME]. There were tears in my eyes!	18
Oh hey, someone with a brain. Rare round here. 	22
Far enough, np. Its rough communicating sarcasm in text form, especially nowadays with Poe's law in overdrive. 	9
Thanks for the info! Safe scooting.	15
People are very complicated.	6
Dont look back at the salt pillars, trust me.	4
That's awesome to hear. Now withdraw every dime from that website and never go back to it ever again.	0
Wait, this is actually a really interesting point. That could/should play a factor if he‚Äòs a legitimate candidate. 	0
I know plenty of old people who did just this	4
I feel left out cuz I don‚Äôt get this, can someone explain 	6

Hahaha this is gold	1
Not gonna lie. Sucked out a few, but am really trying to analyze my play afterwards. Thanks!	15
Thank you, thank you. More people need to hear this.	15
I dont disagree with taking the first steps, I just wish we would be even more ambitious. 	8
That‚Äôs nuts about the digging. I wish we had better dog boots that fit them more naturally than what we have.	8
U.S. are going to fuck this [NAME] guy so hard...he's going to need help to remove all the stars from his rectum	2
It is crazy to me that there are even people in this sub that think [NAME] isn't worth his contract.	1
I still can't believe that dude in Whangarei is still allowed to run his business. I wonder how much longer he will keep it up.	26
That sounds exactly like polos	4
I like this one she looks like she's basking in the warmth of the sun and just taking it all in it came out real nice partner	18
LOL watch this with the Raptors' commentary:	1
WOW THATS SO INTERESTING It happens to me so often that when I hear a new word I anticipate it but it all makes sense now	0
Oooooooo, definitely agree on [NAME].	4
Isn't that why [NAME] is playing him?	6
It amazes me that she can FaceTune video	0
I see this a lot on Reddit. Holding a dumb view, dying on a dumb hill just to finally not respond to a breakdown of claims	4
I dont think a murder log that survived what killed off trex counts as cute, even if its only 2 or 3m long. 	10
I tried to write a cheque for a fare when I was a teenager. That did not go down well.	10
I'm just curious, all those people who blamed you for his infidelity, what are they saying now?	7
Wait wait wait... did [NAME] go 61-27??	26
How many guys did they have on IR? I think their top 2 lineman at each spot were out at least. Hell, they almost beat us.	7
Don't you even dare try to put any blame on [NAME]	2
Man that movie is such a classic	0
Might as well do something while you're doing nothing!	5
Oh I don't use Twitter, thank you for sharing that info!	15
I like TRTL.	18
I forgot to reply last night, I talked to Microsoft and their engineers were working on the issue. The store was just not installing for anyone haha	1
You need professional help for that level of paranoia.	5
I cannot sadly, good luck though.	25
Debs a bitch	2
I gotta say, that was a WELL fought period. I was worried a couple times...	19
We all love to read into data without actually reading the data.	18
Pretty unlikely as those polls are worthless. Also there is no way GOP/Trump would have supported [NAME] over [NAME] if they thought he was the stronger of the two	10
Cool thanks for the reply. Always keen to learn from the actual people haha!	15
[NAME]! congratulations! and may [NAME] help you more!	15
Yes, the Raptors need to stop committing dumb fouls.	3
Your post is cogent, rationale and completely confirms what I have always to some degree felt deep down. Thanks for sharing! 	15

I am very happy with play music. please tell me this is a lie	17
Not admitting you like something because some of the fan base sucks is pretty pathetic.	11

I like to think that the next update will add zeros effects towards the tac mask challenge. Speed things up real quick.	20

I noticed a lot of times racists just try to bait people so you did the right thing.	4
Never heard of high app but will look now!! Thanks for posting peeps!	15
Braindead people blocking lane is pure cancer. But the most horrible part of your story is that you got stuck in checkline line for 10 sore minutes.. Wow.	3
If someone calls I will text them and say I can't talk right now. No matter what I'm doing.	20

No one is going to create more competition for themselves	10
Genuinely curious, what year do you think we're in right now?	7

Nah man you need to have NEGATIVE IQ to enjoy that show, cuz the weed ain't working.	9

Whatever you do, don't give your virginity to anyone. You will regret it if you give it up cheaply. 	5
I wish climate change could draw crowds like this. If only it were a more pressing issue. /s	8
Hahaha that‚Äôs amazing. Good for you	5
the fact that [NAME] still exists is somehow the strangest thing about this	26
I don't think that option in ranked would be a good idea.	10

That was honestly my first thought I‚Äôm so glad someone else went there too	17

Wow if ur mom didn‚Äôt come back for her card you were a goner crazy	26
Agreed. I don't know what the middle ground is, but it's somewhere between neglect through inaction and traumatic physical overreaction. 	4
You‚Äôre an amazingly helpful man. All the rumours about you are false.	0
You are awesome, i envy you	0
I never used the word mean. Chill. I said weak and it is. Its sad aswell.	25

Please concentrate on ignoring that hateful troll	5
lots of games have already added what he's asking for, i don't know why he asked the question 	6
I like my coons too	18
The double standard. Taking pictures of women without their permission is taboo and creepy.	11
It happened in back to back home games earlier this season but hasn‚Äôt happened since.	9
Last year was also the first time we drafted a lineman before round three since [NAME], so I think the earlier look at linemen was needed haha	1

Those are liberal comments, you fucking idiot. Liberals are capitalists.	3
I'm going to start this weekend! thanks for the tips.	15
Reminds me of [NAME] from the documentary THIN who purged food through a feeding tube in her stomach. This sounds dangerous.	14
It's ok to debate and reevaluate scientific things. Really it is. Scientism however is the idiology, religion, that useful idiots and politicians are pushing.	4
Again.. lolz.	1
You're right, I should stop being so worried about other people. Family is forever.	4
I don't care, [NAME] tweets make me uncomfortable and I hate him!!! - Liberals	2

Cant you just feel the unconditional love <3	18

It's just the reliability of a Honda. But I don't know a whole lot.	6
Which was even more possible 2 years ago. It‚Äôs tougher now than it was with a larger republican majority.	22

How poignant.	25
I think I‚Äôd take the long view - the good news is that at least she‚Äôs not pregnant...	17
We‚Äôve been watching OP for awhile and warned him about his posts. This one doesn‚Äôt rise to the level we warned him about.	9
This is love <3	18

I can't remember a time during my early childhood where I didn't dress up like my mom and almost break my little ankles in her heels	25

You don't need to escape to have fun, if you want to win just get some friends to play with.	17
This is funny though.	1
Men find that attractive because it's distinctly feminine. Well, let me add, women who love women love it for the same reason. 	18
I guess that depends on the department. If you've racked up a ton of vacay time, it's possible for some cops to smoke weed lol.	1

Awesome ! That will be worth multitudes one day for certain. And such a classy gentleman, [NAME] is the best in NHL	0
The fact that [NAME] was not mentioned in this thread confuses and upsets me.	9
This was going on for like half an hour. He was drunk and causing trouble, so the tram drivers warned each other not to let him up.	4
that looks like a nightmare.	14
I haven't heard that name in SO LONG. They had this GBA game that was one of my favorite games of all time!	17
I think that's how the game will end. With [NAME] talking to [NAME] again. Don't know if I'm prepared for that	6
This is truly the most captivating trilogy I‚Äôve ever read. Eager to read the third story.	0
Hey thanks!	15
Could not agree more!!	10

Hahaha the build up is hilarious and the ending is the best. They really think he is badass	1
2017's sky high fees proved that this tech fails on a large scale. It's a disappointing reality.	9

Please come and visit again soon! Have a safe flight!	5
Two twin mattress on the floor of my room pushed together. Luckily one of us has a particular love for the middle.	18
[NAME] sure saved that one from swirling down the toilet. Thank you [NAME].	15
No. Spend all of it ASAP. Spend the evidence so you can get rid of it quickly and safely while also still being able to buy shit!	5
Doesn't explain why Tech only has 2 attempts, been driving the entire half.	7
Never thought of that. Now i dislike Heaven more than before.	9

I'm still rocking my Pebble 2SE.	4

Thanks for the laugh lol	15
Don't be angry. Encountering toxic people in online games is common and you won't change that. Try playing single-player or games with more sophisticated community	5
An attractive woman falling down and exposing her butt. It's weird that he'd go so 0 to 60 on such a thing.	11

Make a change make it small and manageable. Go for a walk. Smile at people.	5
Am I getting old or is that just really dumb?	6
I highly doubt they would do that in CA. That would put prices at 36$/pack and no one is going to pay 9$/pod.	10
Fucking refs suck my balls.	2
Bump stocks too I guess, I can't imagine why he actually did that though, perhaps his advisors told him to do it to pander	9
Lmao do you just watch for the gameplay? Wow idiot. There's more to Youtube than gameplay. F***. Off.	1
I like it	18
But then they couldn't be a self-martyring, violent tankie and that's not as much fun.	10
if its not for [NAME] i will combust into flames and I will die	20
Meh, it‚Äôs ‚Äúnext man up‚Äù over there. I‚Äôll be worried when they stop making it to the playoffs. 	19
That was the first thing we tried and we could not get it to work.	9
Aw thanks for the hug, and yeah he did sound like a jerk. 	15

Thanks! Life often ends up being the most beautiful when you least expect it :)	15
That's honestly what I thought too!!	4
What an obnoxious, drunk girl. 	11
It wasn't an intelligent comment to begin with why would I take it seriously? Though I guess those 28 people did.	6
Think its time you let your butterfly self out, dear....	5
Haha, I wish, but not happening	8
Who da fuck wears swim trunks to a competition	2
These are some of the lamest threatening letters I‚Äôve ever seen. She‚Äôs a metahuman who can you murder people with her voice.	14
Oh, I felt that despondency at the end there. Poor guy. 	9
Glad you're rid of me? Pretty obviously breaking the sub rules there.	9
Due to work, gotta stay legal. Edibles aren‚Äôt legal yet sadly. Fortunately not taking it for cancer though, just pain.	25

Haha oops **amiodarone. This is why we need safety checks for drug orders. ;)	1
So, [NAME] was also paying to allow her to eat healthier. Let‚Äôs look at the bright side! 	4
He appeals to the conversation. Basically doesn‚Äôt have a firm stance on anything of much importance and will flip flop based on his guest.	10
What an immature response. With a little passive agressive racism to boot. Classy.	2
Levels mate. Absolutely obsessed with our dominance.	25
As a fellow artists and raised by an N I just want to say congrats.	15
Luv ya too buddy üòù	18
Great tips thank you!	15
Shame. CLG [NAME] could've been a thing.	12

what time is it now? i‚Äôm definitely in a different time zone	6
I mean it‚Äôs kind of weird that they miss that part we‚Äôre the Bible acknowledges other gods for selfish reasons	3

Not sure if you're joking. Not sure if I disagree. But since the point of high school is daytime teenager containment google would not accomplish that.	10

It looks nineteen to me.	4
Keep your expectations low and you're less likely to be disappointed?	4
Made me chuckle.	1
"I mean, okay...I don't support those so-called ""religious liberty"" laws, soo...there's that."	10

Why on earth would that happen? Do you really just discard all reality and think of things in terms of a pantomime?	7
Did you miss the other guys link? I noticed you didn't make a comment towards him, even though he posted it around the same time.	7

Shut up [NAME] we‚Äôve had enough of experts	2

So it's okay when [NAME] does it. But when I do it. I'm being weird. I see. Got it.	4
Even [NAME] got sick of grunge	25

I personally like [NAME] and think he could be on the team right now, but the Org doesn't agree.	9
I just don't get how so many people on this sub know that about the Dems but still manage to get taken in by the [NAME].	6
Just curious, why do you think that? He has ~ 80% approval among registered [NAME] 	7
I thought it was his nose sliced off, got confused when I didnt see any blood	6

Seeing happy people isn't motivating because it shows how easy it is and how I'm failing at something literally everyone else on the planet can do	9
You suck at trolling. It's way too obvious.	3
Nothing. Fuck the environment so people can think they saved a few bucks. People are fucking stupid.	2
Windbreakers, we‚Äôre supposed to wear them when it‚Äôs cold as apparently a joke to keep us warm üôÉ I hate doing drive ups now	2

Sorry for your loss. My bestfriend is turning 13 soon and I'm trying to cherish every minute we still have.	25
Good luck tomorrow! I had to go back last Wednesday. The only silver lining was that it was a short week.	20
They‚Äôre not just investments. They‚Äôre deliberately exploitative and China‚Äôs not operating in good faith	10
TL;DR No more Superbowls for [NAME]. Get ready for another winning season that ends in disappointment.	9

Neither are foreign coups set up with the countries chamber of commerce and the head of the army.	10

Thank you for responding with truth to a top comment that is intentionally very misleading	15
I am really intrigued why you worded the title this way.	7
That‚Äôs horrible. Only religion could make an otherwise normal person want to show a torture and murder video to a child.	14
We‚Äôre still commenting on a video of a dog farting and a cat throwing up right?	6
And are millennials supposed to be attracted to these? If anything I'd be more offended than encouraged to join.	7

Lmao all these othr trades happened so I think it's a silly marketing ploy.	1
Yea I guess I did. I forget how popular the bulls brand is overall. I just hate when people call others dumb because they talk/tweet in slang.	11
Actually that's the wrong guy. The guy you're thinking of is in prison now facing life. This guy sucks just as bad though..	10
Haha the death and suffering here! Haha he had kids! Haha he was a philanthropist! Haha you might be a sociopath.	1

I didn‚Äôt like him before this, now I really don‚Äôt like him. 	2
I don't know where exactly but these pictures are really good. Keep it up!	0
this is proper funny actually	1
Totally agree. Their Rogue One commentary track is the only one I've never replayed, simply because he makes the same damn joke throughout the whole thing.	4
Have you ever tried to give her lessons in cooking? It could be fun and a bonding for you both.	7
Hey friendo nothing down here but there are ALL SORTS of interesting smells!	4
Thank you [NAME]. Best of luck. I'll always remember your goal to clinch MLS Cup 2017.	15
Looks nice but will wait for a PVE dedicated map as that‚Äôs more my jam.	4
I've never seen anyone do it successfully on a car, but I'll concede that it could definitely be possible.	20
I gotta try that with my posse next time I‚Äôm on. That‚Äôs hilarious	1
did he give up out of embarrassment having knocked back chicago for us and then not getting to join us.	7
He looks like the demon all the other demons beat up for lunch money	0
The most sense the internet has produced in a long time. [NAME] bless this dude.	15
Resisting not being under arrest? What?	7
Wow! I didn't even know there was a handball world championship.	26
Reality is often disappointing	9
I played on the Wii and used Windows XP computers up until 2011 lol. The feeling of the 90‚Äôs died in 2001 but the pop-culture remained.	1
I thought that I was lagging. yeah, its really bad.	22
Please keep going, this is just making you look worse	5
Now go to a return? Oh ok, thanks for the store to find something better.	15
How many of each have been killed or injured?	7
By that logic its seedy and insincere for google to act like they care about Homealone.	9
Damn! Kids these days don‚Äôt give me much hope for the future. It‚Äôs supposed to be a flaming dr pepper ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è	3
Wow. That scene would‚Äôve made knocked up much better.	0
You are a true hero	0
I'm not going out of my way to watch it but I might channel flip	10
Close the door, you're letting the heat out!	3
Happy Anniversary!	13

"But terrible people is my ""type"""	14
I liked the comeback tho	4
Did anyone else notice [NAME]' face twitching a little?	7
OH MY [NAME]	26

"I read it as baby sitter and for really confused at the ""she decided she wanted to walk"" part"	6
> So having sex is a medical condition? no but std's are	6
I do have EAP and was lucky enough to get 10 sessions using it. I‚Äôll chat with my boss tomorrow about taking time off. Thank you!	15
They‚Äôre words and they‚Äôre hilarious	1
Who is your least hated and absolute worst? (Outfit based only)	11
[NAME] isn't really that bad, he's also a cheaper option who [NAME] trusts.	0
While out at the beach for a weekend for her birthday. There was no final straw, I just wanted to. 	9
Ikr. Spend your time doing better things like reading [NAME] fanfics ‚ù§Ô∏è	18
Proud of you!	21
Thanks! I‚Äôll be sure to do that!	15
[NAME] IS SO OLD HIS FAVORITE ROUTES ARE TO THE CVS AND CRACKER BARREL.	2
It developed because of my childhood and robbed me of a good bit of good stuff as an adult.	9
I also have a boner!	4
This is irrelevant to what we were talking about.	10
Our knight in shining armor. I'll miss those high socks	9
Thank you so much, I‚Äôll be following this and try to consult my parents Incase I am unsure of what else he may say.	15
I thought it was illegal to practice ninjutsu	22
thank [NAME]. maybe we will finally get to have some proof of life for [NAME] and get some answers about [NAME].	20
Fuck it, it's time we spend not adding to the debt	3
One good thing about vaping When it hits you, you feel no pain. 	0
Ope, got a lil chuckle outta me there, sorry	24
It's no coincidence that I became generally happier when I realized that once I covered the necessities more stuff didn't bring more happiness.	0
I agree with everything you said, except the Witten part he is [NAME] awful....that whole MNF crew makes it unwatchable.	4
Love me some Black and Tans, also love Snake Bites as well. 	18
Haha mines an old 2.5L 2002 non turbo. But I love it.	18
She actually survived the incident, I don‚Äôt know if anyone has the article	6
That‚Äôs a pretty great play mate. I applaud you.	0
Yeah no...I would find it very demeaning	10
Thanks for the reply! May I ask what part of the world you're from?	15
It definitely revealed how ugly the hatred on the Left has gotten.	3
Interesting, I know another millionaire who takes to Twitter and rambles in an attempt to distract people from negative news about him... 	0
I'm giving you an upvote for that perfect comeback, but I'm not happy about it!	9
She is looking like [NAME] to me in this pic.	0
This is so creepy. Good riddance to awful rubbish.	11
It's absolutely 100% abuse, as others have said you need to get the hell away from him.	10
Every government in the world charges these fees. Welcome to the real world.	22
As opposed to becoming a U.S. citizen the illegal way?	6
FUCK TAMPA. FUCK TORONTO. WE WINNING THE MOTHERFUCKING CUP	17
Great way to be late on 80% of your orders. I mean I didn't say it was impossible, but you put rating at risk	0
Yeah wat a fucking knob right? Fucking nick...	2
Lol I know right?	1
Thx! Happy New Year!	15
<3 [NAME]. You were too good for this world.	0
SHIT. I just gave my son some Skittles. Lemme edit that right quick LOL	3
came here to say this. i've watched it through more than five times at this point. one of my absolute favorites.	18
I‚Äôm just glad to finally see something truly cringy in a while	12
I totally agree with you. Porn is unnatural and creates honorless cuckolds.	4
Please don't come back.	10
I like to support anybody who supports veganism, especially at places like this, to show them their is a demand, and a future for it	8
I honestly wouldve thought the same if i hadnt seen it here before either. Is all good brother. Happy hunting!	5
Is this a real thing!?! (I am clearly very sheltered)	26
We have had luck with a ok to wake clock for quiet time! May be worth a shot.	20
No way!? Ugh this just sounds painful	10
I'm 27 and still look 15. When does this change?	7
I don't blame you. It was a long post. Thanks for your time.	15
You dont need elected officials to have power when you have the people on your side.	10
I hope it goes just as well. Good luck.	20
Might is generous lol. He totally killed that guy.	1
You want me to go searching around for that? I'm good. I'll just assume you're wrong because of the way you type.	7
I would love to see your evidence for any of this above and below stuff. Go ahead, I'll just wait right here....	18
Like a turd in a big toilet	3
Yes it does count	4
That was quick lol. I like what I see so far too but come on	1
He is holding you hostage. Sad state of affairs.	25
I appreciate the advice! This is something I‚Äôve been trying to figure out, like I said.	0
While we appreciate trying to help with the report function, next time either block them after or ignore them instead of getting into a fight. Thanks.	15
My pleasure ‚ò∫Ô∏è hope you enjoy! She seems very sweet.	17
My mistake lol	1
Everybody is just temporarily embarassed millionaires	12
Nah they'll make their own post that's really passive aggressive about SOME people not understanding [insert fatlogic excuse here]	10
And unfortunately videos like this act as a constant reminder that most people are complete dumbasses. Sad really.	25
Yes, they suck for making a profit off of people who are proven to be high risk. How dare they!	2
Very good fight. The red head above the M is hot and very distracting.	0
No they shouldn't. Mental illness is a serious thing and we shouldn't encourage crazy people but instead help them	10
Because it contains the nudity of a child, and that is a federal crime?	7
I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not. Either way. Lol	1
When did we get rid of uprights? He was amazing for us?	7
I love you.	18
Oh! Thank you!	15
Yeah I hope he can play against IU that‚Äôd be a huge loss	9
> if nine out of ten girls were going to reject me, I would approach twenty. That sounds like a threesome	1
A radical departure from the lunacy we have now? Yes.	4
I'm 27 and I want to live in a society that shuts down at 8pm!	8
How did you get access to PCTC?	7
don't you hate it when that dogs are doing drugs behind your house?	3
I discovered this show on the cnn docuseries about the nineties. What a terrible idea for a show üòÇüòÇ	14
What a steal that was	0
Okay this is racist fear mongering. I got it now thanks.	15
>!why you bully me :,0 i didn't even know what a mantis was before this conversation!<	6
What a poor woman who only wanted to tell someone what to do.	25
I love this pic... believe me I am up for some reason my hands on you.	18
Does taking a small jab at [NAME] shrek 2 mean something has to be wrong with me? What a fragile world you must live in...	6
"[NAME], I've told you already. ""Muy gorda chica"" does not mean ""very pretty girl"" "	10
[NAME] fucking christ. When [NAME] came into the league he was pretty much as skinny as [NAME] is now. And look at the dude now.	26
"The fact that ""TrueChristian"" and ""TrueChristianity"" are so [RELIGION] is extremely telling. The faith is dishearteningly fractured..."	25
That's awful. If I were a celebrity, I would probably do the same.	11
Well, I probably would have been against the Cespedes signing if we had to sign him for 7 years. But that goes more for a pitcher.	10
Happy birthday!	17
Surprisingly all of my family keep their toasters on the work top despite being [RELIGION]/Unionist ?	26
This guy gets it...	4
I absolutely love it that EVERYONE is scoring... please keep this up for the rest of the season.	18
I‚Äôm not going to live in the middle of nowhere. I like Chicago.	10
Know when to shut up, you have to. Needs to learn she does. Nice job.	4
We're like bad luck lightning rods. Everybody around us is safe	9
The best feeling ever was when class was over and it never got to your turn, so you didnt have to present until the next day	17
Yikes on the sauce!!	26
yesterday was a fucking travesty to the game of basketball	2
Huh, I wonder why the NFL doesn't have the umpire line up there anymore?	6
Thank [NAME].	15
I completely agree with mondawggg. Playing the petty way instead of discussing the issue with him directly is so much more productive....wait	4
That‚Äôs a new level of blonde I never knew existed!	26
I honestly do not know. Chastise them for their hardness of heart and presumptiveness I suppose. I guess that is what [NAME] would do.	3
Oh hahaha, is it a reputable vendor?	1
That Man has one of the coolest tattoos on his knee I've ever seen.	0
Looks just like the snow we've been getting in Halifax recently! (Canada)	4
Do you want to be promoted to Secreatary of State for the US?	7
And this young man wishes to be an athlete. That sort of strenuous activity would not be possible.	10
In the cap era no goalie has played as much as [NAME] has the last 2 years on a per games basis	0
I was very tunnel visioned at first haha didn‚Äôt even notice the arm	1
I had 175/1 back in March. About to go to Vegas again and it will be disappointing to only get 12/1 this time.	9
look at more of [NAME] work, he really makes the picture come to life.	0
That.. would be glorious. A large one of these would be the NZ equivalent of Giga Pudding.	0
That's interesting! Here I am having been saying I grew up near the original all my life. I will correct my story.	13
We had a baby, it's hard to find the time to take them down.	25
I stopped watching after I had to suffer through a whole episode without [NAME] removing his shirt	4
People like you are why I follow this sub. Keep it up I need more laughs like that!	4
This kid now: fun yay hahoo This kid as a grownup: I regret everything	24
Was it? Honestly I didnt get it, even asked some other people and they didnt get. I guess color me ignorant. Care to explain? 	7
The World Between Worlds veered worryingly close to this territory. Luckily it was handled well.	20
From barrel to a tank! Great job! :)	0
[NAME] is my daddddyyy!!!! And I can‚Äôt be on this planet without her/him!!!!!	18
Its one thing to LOSE a debate, its another to be disqualified for wrong think. 	3
I've seen muuuuuch weirder. But that was confusing as hell. LOL!	1
the lack of respect for [NAME], [NAME] and the rest of the [NAME] in here is incredible	0
luckily i do not have mixxed cycles myself... rapid cycling, sure, not mixed episodes though. sending hope your way!!	20
I feel like it's a one big woosh	4
My heart is breaking for you OP... good luck on your job search though!!	5
Don‚Äôt blame [NAME] there tf is he supposed to do if our wing can‚Äôt stay in front of their man	10
Nah, I know why I am depressed, and I'm sorry to say it has nothing to do with you. 	24
I kind of want to try that now actually. With some chocolate added I think it could work.	8
It‚Äôs an imperfect poll demographic group skewing erroneously towards a ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. [NAME] was incredible this week.	10
I wonder how many didn't get the joke	26
I won't stop crying üò≠	25
MOTHERFUCKING FLYING MONKEYS, AHHHHHHHHGHGHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!	2
Yeah I doubt the woman would post about it whilst still in his bed. She'd wait until she was dumped then complain about it at least.	6
I'm sorry you had a bad experience, that's horrible. But that number saved one of my friends lives. Different for everyone	14
She‚Äôs my favorite too. She is indeed hella cute.	0
Makes sense, thanks!	15
Reality is often disappointing	9
Wait so his eyes don't work? Then how does he put his penis in your vagina?	6
Pls shut up	3
Yeah but you‚Äôve already told one side that you‚Äôre playing both sides	3
His last post to T_D was to try and rile people up to get [NAME]	3
Who said anyone was white or black? Forget it, trumpie. You clowns don‚Äôt care about the truth. 	3
They'd probably just use it to buy up armies and navies for tyrants who oppress and reign with blood and horror or some shit.	3
I thought it was something about the dog not smelling your drugs, but now i'm just sad that you didn't get to pet it :(	25
It was stupidmancostume	2
I am so happy that sub exists	17
"More like ""thank you sir may I have another"""	15
Keep dreaming. He isn't coming to this black hole of an organization.	10
I feel sorry for her son that must have been super cringe	25
Just stop.	2
I love it here too.	18
I like this man.	18
because your brain will associate the drip taste with the high after a few times, i love the drip	18
[NAME]. Please, [NAME]. 	8
Oh sorry. Instead of ‚Äúwillfully stupid ‚Äú I meant, why do you hate America?	24
Thankfully. We have highly responsible gun owners and our gun control is fairly effective. We have way less violence and people generally can still enjoy them.	15
I hate these cakes so much.	11
I'm thankful every day I was in school before the Internet, smart phones and social media.	15
I wish my phone was that accurate. It warns me I'm at 14%, then 10 minutes later it drops to 0% and shuts off.	8
I‚Äôm happy I could help. Let me know if it works	17
"Oh like ""both of."" Gotcha. Good times"	17
This is on a video about electric guitars what the fuck?	2
Cool story bro	20
Thank you for giving my Zumba songs some context	15
Good catch. I guess I was just remembering the shift after the first debate. That's pretty sad, tbh. 	25
I was flabbergasted when I saw it.	26
Which sex communicates better? Typically women. Don't judge this guy like your girlfriends. he sounds pretty normal to me.	4
A drummer's MC is the best MC	0
That's why imo [NAME] death is better.	16
You know, I didn‚Äôt have an anxiety attack all day. Thanks for ensuring it happened. 	3
Sure, but it's been all over the news recently with the [NAME] doc that just came out. I've seen tons of posts here on reddit.	4
If your partner is so consumed by his addiction that he chose it over you, you know what to do.	5
Our mod is an awesome mod	0
You‚Äôre right but territories haven‚Äôt been around for decades	4
Was referring to their government, should have specified that better. 	22
"*concussion* *Trophy system kills it* *Another concussion* *Trophy system kills it* ""Yo guys watch me throw this cluster"" Honestly embarrassing "	12
You got whooshed fair and square. Take your medicine.	5
This is maybe the lamest way you can say that.	3
dont get down on yourself, early NC is very daunting. good luck! (im 11 years NC from nmom....life is good!) 	20
And isolated rooms? When I had to go in with my baby with chickenpox they put us in a room where no one else was.	7
If she canf even protect herself what the fuck is she doing in a business that protects others.	2
The most hatful crowd is not the lefties. Lefties may be annoying but hate as such is a tool used by the right much more skillfully and forcefully.	3
Lol shit yeah.	1
I suppose I failed to lay the sarcasm on thick enough, should have gone with the full billion dollar contract... Oh well, live and learn! lol 	1
both are bad tho anarchy ftw	10
"Hopefully he gets what he is looking for. Not sure why some people are getting pissy over this. ""How dare he look out for himself, REEEEEE!"" "	20
Yeah i also like [NAME] now but that gives me a horrible idea. What if we think the same about fortnite later	6
I‚Äôm definitely leaving him. I have a 0 tolerance for cheating and won‚Äôt be staying for it to happen again	2
I think theres a line between edgy and racist that this meme clearly crosses. [NAME] is still funny, this is just racist.	1
Oh god I thought he career was long over	9
not surprised it‚Äôs too challenging for you to read	5
Me too. One of my favorite potential Dem candidates	18
"""Someone else must start this however... but I will sure join in the violent fight that will ensue... I promise!"""	4
one quick glance at your comment history negates any value in this comment	10
I'm so sorry for your loss. One of my favourite unisex names is [NAME].	24
That does suck. I‚Äôm sorry. Having recently been ghosted by someone who I thought was a very close friend, it‚Äôs a terrible feeling	14
Thank you.	15
my gawd! This is adorable!	1
I went to the pharmacy to get vaccinated (sign said for free) and they turned me down for not having health insurance... so	9
I'm always happy to have you in my box.	17
It *feels* unethical?	11
I don't need a pogram. The best targ killers are other targs	10
edit: black gays and trans in the ball scene started it, much like a lot of our gay slang 	4
Hard to follow after reading his post history. Says he is divorced...	25
Lets just say its probably cheaper to just hope a more positive outlook reflects on your out-look.	20
Oh my [NAME].	26
I failed with my play on words. Oh well, can't win them all	24
Comedown is only a tenth of addiction. Addiction is when you find a high that you love more than yourself. Be careful.	5
Thanks I will try to delete the multiples. Good luck on everything.	15
For her? Nah	10
[NAME] keeps getting set to get a rebound [NAME]	1
Sadly I think this is true & maybe this is the incentive adults need to get into action	25
Thanks for the clarification :)	15
Yeah I wish they hadn't opened the entire game with the ol' [NAME].	8
I‚Äôve seen it too. I think it was an honest mixing of the words.	4
Doesn't matter what we do. The announcers will trash the Wolves and praise the Lakers. I miss [NAME] and [NAME].	9
I was surprised too	26
Ive always wanted someone to tell me how beautiful my protein powder looks.	0
I swear to [NAME], these offseason dream/hypothetical lineups get me rock solid every single time. I love it	18
Yeah lazily typing a naughty word to some retard on the internet is a real indicator of being angry rofl	1
Not even polite if they're driving. The road rage here is terrifying.	14
Naw dude, other sports never have ankle injuries so they are fine. 	5
I'm glad to see when people succeed! I'm very happy for ya and life is going uphill which is always a great sign	17
i am shocked... SHOCKED I TELL YOU!	26
Ayyy exactly!	4
Her accent!! I died.	16
I mean, this very post is climate change denial related, which has zero to do with the second amendment, so I don't get your point 	10
Well then his whole argument is a straw man itself, because nobody advocates abortions of fully formed babies	10
thank you for your answer	15
i hate furries	2
#Fuck the cowgirls & iggles	2
They wont investigate cause the damage isn't worth $1000+	10
"i guess there is nothing wrong if i say ""May [NAME] grant you love, guidance and happiness"" And yes, that was directed towards you"	18
Quitting porn only helped with my performance in bed, other than that I‚Äôm still anxious as hell in social spots 	19
That's no excuse.	10
Well all I can say is I'm sorry and May [NAME] open your heart one day.	24
I LOVE THIS TEAM	18
[NAME] ‚Äú I‚Äôm afraid if I don‚Äôt have money she‚Äôll leave me‚Äù. Yuh, you‚Äôre exactly right [NAME].	14
I was honestly shocked when they denied an overpayment, especially since after the charges cleared it would have been a $0 balance.	26
Good to see [NAME] getting some love.	18
You're clearly reporting all of my comments, and then acting like you don't know why they could get deleted haha, that's hilarious.	1
I can finally block Post Mallone and all that repetitive weird rap that ppl play on my Spotify during parties.	23
I don't think eating 4chan pizza is a good idea. Unless you're into some weird shit.	11
While I have no experience in dating/relationships, I have been through unrequited love. So I learnt that the hard way	22
So happy I bought a PC. If you‚Äôre looking for a better experience across ALL games I suggest you do the same.	17
I fucking cant stop laughing. It's so bad it's good.	1
Does anyone know if there's a place I can donate to help her two little kids?	7
Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society.	3
Oooh dont call the bad guys for help when your life is at risk okay.	5
We stick out in a crowd. You can run with it or hide from it. I love embracing it!	18
cool story bro	0
I feel like it took for fucking ever actually. Still too fast, but anything would be	3

That was the one I was thinking of! I can't remember which episode it was on now, but it fantastic	0
this is why I have backups off site that they‚Äôll never find...try as they will they will never disarm me	20
Wow... drug smugglers will always find a way I guess. I bet that took a ton of work	26
Oh man. You're the cutest.	0
Hoping to make it to Seattle soon. I‚Äôll make sure to reach out.	20
we are scared on /r/bengals rn	14
Eat better.	5
Don't apologize it has nothing to do with you, everyone here understands that.	5
It‚Äôs 5:11am over here. Good luck dude.	5
Me too! I don't believe in likes or karma points, but I know other people care and it might be the highlight of their day.	10
I feel like I‚Äôve seen these before... but when I was very little	6
Anyone else see her 10 year challenge post today or yesterday. I'm so shocked she wouldn't pick this picture.	26
How much? Out of curiosity‚Äôs sake	7
What about the small percentage that would?	7
Something my mom always told me is to say what you‚Äôre going to use a gift for in your thank you note.	15
I wish. It's been over 72 hours for me now, nothing. Less than .5 ETH, BCH and BSV - hasn't moved.	8
We‚Äôre playing well, except for a 2 minute stretch. As is tradition	0
Compelling argument, in line with expectation	10
If you keep grinding you could become rookie of the year 2020 imo	0

cheers for the replies guys. appreciated	0
Dude want's to help his mother... cool I do the same, my mom lives in my basement. But he is doing it with my money!	3
He has the maturity of a 2 year old and you are right...ugly in his soul.	11
May [NAME] SWT bless you, protect you, guide you, and keep you active in this faith. Welcome to al [RELIGION] =)	15
happens all the time (at least to me) when you have a bad ping (80+), games broken lol	1
That dog was so happy I thought he was gonna start flying like tails the fox in sonic	17
This is absolutely the stupidest mock I've seen this year	1
Hope you're doing okay!	20
Thanks bot!	15
Okay... am I the only one curious how in the hell a fourth grader managed to get expelled?	7
>it tasted horrible to use. Eating some of that right now. No regrets.	11
at least it rhymes,i'll give you that	4
It was SO refreshing to see. [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME] were all so well coordinated. Hype	0
seems odd, when you guys consume much more pizza, I would say overall than us	12
I mean yeah that's really it. Getting him on tape saying racist stuff is the only possibility of a sale.	4
So much fake news.	3
That's a great trailer. [NAME] needs more scars though.	0
The only sub that‚Äôs really bad now is the GKS the others are fine actually.	10
Our ancestors took this land at great loss and developed into something greater than they were capable of being. Their descendants have the rightful claim to the land.	0
Ditto this. Happy hour after work is nice and low-commitment.	17
A hell of a player when he was at Grimsby. Hope he can pick up some minutes and goals again.	20
Depends on the drug. Weed makes me antisocial and when I'm in public, I feel paranoid and I feel like everyone knows I'm high.	19
True but I think we should be able to strike a deal for less than 50-60m which is worth it in today's market imo	20
oh right that was a huge leap my bad	9
I let my cat lick the leftover milk out of the bowl after I eat cereal, he loves it. 	18
Doesn't mean any of those thing you liked are going to change. Not immediately anyways.	4
I accept your failure and wish you a good day.	5
You need help.	5
Seconded. I had the December one well into January and finally just changed to the Sabres logo. Still cool and all, but the schedules were awesome.	0
Finally! Now I see what I was doing wrong. PB, thank you!	15
Just like demar used to do lol	1
Still depressed but I didn't run away so it cool	9
Sounds hella aggressive. You can say the same thing while being nicer about it.	2
You are an amazingly strong person!	0
In my school we have specific councilors for the students matched alphabetically. Mine just sucks.	21
Ironically, everyone else (except a v small%) are thinking the same, try keeping this in mind next time.. enjoy your day	17
im still starving	25
Oh boy, yeah.	4
Oh no.	26
BTW your story really gave me comfort, Thank you.	15

Weirdly I never heard of this show till I saw it on the RTE player this morning, and now this post... Maybe its a sign? 	6
It's shameful how this sub sold out to Big Broccoli (TM).	12
I‚Äôm sorry and I hope you are better now than when you were in the marriage.	5
These subtitles are stupid & unnecessary.	3
Yes, this. I love this film.	0
And I like the taste	18
Perfect place to get flame grilled by the church then. Bring it on!	0
Got any good examples you care to post?	7
What age are you? I didn't realise you were a child until now.	22
Maybe they are just horrible people, and because you aren't like them they don't like you. 	3
Hypothetical: If you were a GOP senator, who would you want to lead the caucus after [NAME] steps down or is defeated?	6
[NAME] voice was great!! Especially in Night Prowler	0
I haven't seen such an unpopular hire since [NAME].	10

Basically he is trying to start something based on a lie, not good. If I were you, I wouldn't see this person again.	3
This is very [serious], how dare you guys mock this [serious] science?!	2

Oh god, [NAME] is terrible. My kid loves it though, and Dr [NAME]	14
But really though, it really contextualizes how bad this coaching search has been that the Rams' QB coach is the only guy we can be optimistic about	10
Would you‚Äôve still got with her if you‚Äôd known beforehand? No judgement, just curious.	7
When people don't understand things they invent gods. how little we have changed in all these years.	3
True but I am a fan of [NAME] and I'm just relieved he pulled through even if his victory did not make me any richer.	23

Post them all! Love old pics.	18
I dont like my rights being restricted on the grounds of race. That is the issue.	10

what i dont understand is WHY the media hasn't yet picked up this story?? Especially with [NAME] in the zeitgeist.	6
I think it can be good, bad, and everything in between. It's inevitable given the forward progress of civilization.	6

I was looking forward to seeing the new predator, this (the concept, not the spoiler) would have made me dissapointed, yet intrigued	9
No offense but...she's not pretty either so I'm confused why she'd say that car is only for ugly women.	10
I never understood why the idea of always swinging pitches served to you on a plate seems radical.	6
And the human babies - don‚Äôt forget them! Totally wicked! Sad!	25
I'm not a pats fan but the ones that [NAME] and [NAME] post on their IGs are actually pretty cool	0
I dont watch battle rap. Do these guys come up with these on the spot, because that's amazing.	0

LPT for controversial thing use bing. They dont filter as muchas google.	10
We desperately need a veteran WR with so many rookies around. Like a [NAME] for [NAME] and company.	8
[NAME] saying she works all year. Most people work all year that‚Äôs normal!!!	4

Thank you for your wisdom, [NAME]....	15
Wow,29 turnovers. Something to talk about	26

The absolute worst!	11
After 6 weeks, anything becomes a habit I hear. 	22

Oh, I saw it. I was giving him the benefit of the doubt to see if he wound up saying the quiet part out loud.	5
No but that doesn‚Äôt mean people were less happy in the past.	10
Could have been worse if a piece of metal exploded into him instead harmlessly on the beach	11
Did he died?	7
Sounds magical!	13
I was actually thinking naming it hardcore mode Would make it more enticing for people too. Funny you called it that.	1
Mental illness. Operation on 7 people in a manic state . Four of them died. All his money was gone and his rich friends abandoned him.	25
Worrying about [NAME] during a game is ridiculous. Especially when he's currently 6-11 from the field.	14

Not necessarily. Simply giving both of them the legal right to choose to *not* be a parent would create equality within the constraints of biology.	10
The shocking thing about this all is that she seems to be British born. I'd expect this from immigrants, not those born in the UK.	26
You weren‚Äôt here for the original wording but thanks for playing.	15
I enjoyed the 1:50 seconds of this person going about their day uneventfully	17

I dare each or any of you fuckasses to try and blame [NAME] for this one	2
I agree it‚Äôs disrespectful to so blatantly disregard her parents wishes but yes, otherwise too uptight.	4
ROFL! Just about! Didn‚Äôt know someone‚Äôs eyes could bug out of their head like that outside of cartoons. ;-)	1
I regret my psycho ex. Does that mean I was raped? Or do the rules not apply because I'm a man?	2

Seeing this makes me happy. I hope this is true :)	17

Yeah I figured it may be something like that. I was waiting it out too.	22

That username lmao	1
I was actually thinking about that during tonight's episode. I don't think the show would last long without [NAME] though.	22
Yes, very sad but that's the reality of competitive online gaming right now	25
>Dude, nobody reads. That is *really* not true. 	10
To me it looks like they were driving with both feet, as the brakes were on while they were accelerating... Something I will never understand.	6
If you are feeding your two year old 1200 calories then you are fattening them up for the stew lady.	22
The SNP were, I remember [NAME] stridulating about it at conference, but I don‚Äôt think it was a go-er.	10
*youve doomed us all, evacuate the continent immediately*	2
Because in a world of fake people you need strangers being mean to get an honest opinion.	20
But the battle dynamics are sh*t. Every other ME is better in that respect, especially the squad AI is bad. Really bad.	11
It's interesting that you don't address anything but just come to troll	3
Thank you! This feedback is gold to us.	15
Then leave him. You're not married and sexually comparability is a huge part of making a relationship work. Don't underestimate this my friend.	5
His videos are great.	0

I'm unsure how much more I should invest in this train of thought.	6
Not a perfect game with the error	10
Lol I do the same. Sometimes it gets stuck in my head for days.	1
As someone who works in the oil industry with a lot of big ships, this is badass.	10
What about a meet tomorow night (saturday night jan 12th) its supposed to be nice, just let me know and ill swing on by. üëç	17

He probably enjoyed it so much with his frat brothers that he's willing to buck his own party for good weed.	17
calling her a sellout for having a job is hilarious.	1
I see that you also braved the farmers' market this morning!	0
So why did [NAME] leave? They were predictable and mostly tolerable. Three wings is absolutely intolerable. I hate him.	2
If she's making inapropriate claims thats a problem too, Im not exactly sure what your point is?	6
Thanks, the date went really well! I feel for you, it will be a while for me too. 	15
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE ALL CAPS TO GET YOUR POINT ACROSS!!!	10
