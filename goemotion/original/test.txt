I had to write in the Swangas. Seems far better than the choices given.	22
I thought this allegation was squashed when it came out. I was surprised to see it still making headlines. Poor guy.	26
Because of this bad situation some people are afraid of becoming youtubers because of this	14

That's what I'd hope for! Retool the D day 1, if we could find a gem at QB day 2. 	20
Tl, dr - Take the abuse. Squirming only gets them off more.	14

I genuinely think that would be an iconic shot if it was in a famous horror film. The way the legs just keep on coming is terrifying.	14
I’m only denying what’s not true, and [NAME] being my name isn’t true. 	9

Yikes I cringed hard	26
Every time, lots of people overwhelm me. I have light sensitivity to florescents so that doesn't help. 	9
No idea but as of last year there was a cat that liked to hang out there. Hope he’s okay ❤️	20

How dare you, she's in your flair too!	2
But the best part is the struggle snuggle as we like to call it.	0

The wage, you Fucking troll. But you don't care do you? See your post history.	2
Happy MLK day	17
Good point. Thank you. My condolences for your own loss.	15
Same.. If I'm particularly stressed out someone just walking down the same road as me feels like they're invading my space.	4
RNG-based access to very important mechanics is frustrating for some people.	3
It is. It’s so bad. Then I start blaming myself for liking them. It’s like I have no control over this.	9
Yes I keep hearing it’s a great and eye opening read so it on my to read list. thanks 👍	15
It is certainly interesting.....but is it anything?.....	7
I love this cross-over	18
I’m scared of shots, but I’m more scared of dying. What Anti-vaxxers are scared of is autism	14

Thanks [NAME] for holding on to our $17.5M. We will be needing that back though.	15
Wow. Thanks for this.	15
Maybe I’m unsure of that	6
I agree with this, but I'm guessing it's because he works from home and can work anywhere while she can't.	4
Well everyone is entitled to their opinion but I think you need to be a bit more mature about everyone having different bodies	5
I'm as big a packers fan as the next guy, but that car is ugly lol	1

Congrats on the sex!	0
yeah I agree w you, just annoying that the limit is so small	4
I'm sorry you needed to add this. I thought your humour was pretty obvious, but this is reddit....	10
Firm, but gentle. Baby hamsters or live goldfish. Soft female hands caressing my balls is a wonderful feeling. 	17
All the people in this thread are fucking disgusting	11
Sadly enough I was thinking the same.	24
you dirty karma theft	2
I've seen that profile picture before..this guy is a repeat offender	10
Yes! My SO does that, unfortunately the requirements are stricter and I can't :(	9
No because thats stupid	2
I feel a sense of unease tbh	19
middle of lane is dumb that’s where all the oil pools, lane split seems like no one likes it but that’s more understandable	10
That doesn’t even look like her! Except the [NAME] in the background, now that’s the one we know and love.	10
Oh that's good!	0
I believe it was clear I disagreed. And I don’t play wow.	10

I'm glad you did because this was the comment where I stopped my fast scroll haha.	15
damn that kid can jump	13
you in the wrong *childhood*	3
shockingly close to reality.	26
Don't chase after out of position teammates. Your life as a Mercy is more important. Let them fools die and learn their lesson.	3
But what’s the point of not having the brakes?	7

You give me too much credit... That comment is as trash as the meme	11
No thanks, he’s already been flushed	10
Honestly his post was a little sad. The fact that it got upvotes makes me want to avoid this sub over the summer.	25
At my job I can/Do get laid a lot so the second one!!	4
Wtfffff why can’t I have all of the benefits and none of the consequences :( :(	7
Yeah that was inexcusable	2

Right on [NAME] having a big year, but [NAME] was super disappointing this year.	9

But for real. Like, phones, you guys. Am I right?	6
Wonder if it’s possible for [NAME] to engage with a polite fan in a magnanimous way.	26
I for one am happy for [NAME] ballin out. Now let's go win this game !!!!	17
If you think all manufactured foods haven't got those contaminants then you're sadly mistaken.	10
I love how he looks around for a flag and doesn’t celebrate at first	18
Right. He didn't even say a word. I feel like I've seen this before tho.	22

His army of Swedish blondes are going to be upset.	9
>Sorry, but any city that had any kind of ~~epidemic in its~~ history will have bunches of dead people buried under it.	24
I agree. There was just a big disconnect. They weren't talking specifically about masculinity but about certain situations that are toxic.	4
This makes me so happy!	17
Yeah... THEY are the one looking for attention. This type of comments should be ignored. I hate troll comments.	2
I disagree. In that I believe that season 3 was also very good. I think it's better than season 4.	10
Nobody likes you nonhuman mimics and everyone knows what you are.	3
Hold my wine, I have to go vomit in sorrow. 	25

My wife would say that all of the above and another dozen more are cheating...and she wonders why I’ve fucked other women...	26
Exactly. So many people live here because they love public transit. It is an ammenity. NJ is not trying to make a profit from the PATH.	18
Got me spitted coffee all over my phone🤣	1
Just like that fucking idiot that was just trying to kidnap that woman, and chased her into a Karate studio... turned out just about the same.	2

You’ll struggle to get premier league tickets (without paying a hefty premium) so concentrate on the lower leagues.	5
I agree. I was merely attacking the fragility and ineffectiveness of democracy. Thanks for the example!	15
Oh alright fair enough haha. If the sabres dont pan out I'll root for him also!	1
Please tell me that's not real... I haven't played the Assassin's Creed games... But do they really include such an obnoxious disclaimer?	7

Why not? Just go for it. It'll make a great story to tell at your 50th wedding anniversary party.	0
This is an uninformed and incorrect statement. It doesn’t take even close to that long.	10
Nah man I prefer endless cause of the part where he goes WOMWOMWOMWOMWOMWOM WOOOOOO REEEEEEEEE like that's lyrical genius right there	10

Surprised to not see Three Arrows on the list when he went from no videos at all to over 100,000 subscribers just in the course of 2018.	26
I don't remember, it was all very hazy...	9
Scary stuff.	14
I love this!!! You got it!	18
But he makes her vagina sing! How else is she supposed to act around him. Haha	1
I like your style, let's not wait on any historians to miss any opportunities. 	18

I love how serious and mad cats get when the dog starts messing around with them all playful	18
Ah ok, that makes more sense. I don’t think most [NAME] would see your last name and try to make it French, lol.	10
I sure hope so! Otherwise, I've been in the wrong sub.	20
Yeah, sadly, looks like this champ will be pretty opressive. 	25
Can’t wait for the saas drama!!! 😂😂	13
Yeah I know what you meant. Fuck the police, most of them are vile pieces of shit, they deserve every kick in the back they get.	2
What a turnaround.	26
Meanwhile my sister won’t even hug my goodbye when I drop her off at school.	25
It's not free, though. It's ridiculously expensive.	3
Heh, don't know how it was back then but I'd really suggest giving it a spin now - it's like life-consumingly good!	0
That is patently false, considering his history of driving multiple businesses into the ground.	10
Pretty sure you could do that with a cargo ship too, so I'm not sure I buy that argument.	6
[NAME] has some great videos on the guy. He's definitely a piece of work.	0

He’s gone soon I would imagine, hope we can get a late-mid round pick for him, like a 5th	20
Yeah that's not nearly as dramatic and aggressive as the ball in the above video.	10
Lol there you go. Forgot to switch back from your alt for a second there.	1
I love [NAME], but this sounds like he’s claiming signing a 26 year old superstar is stupid. Come on.	18
This is his speculation or a leak?	6
Got a good laugh out of that. Plenty of wall of shame material.	1
Some of them will have to get new vehicles to meet the requirements. That means we get cleaner air. Where's the problem exactly?	4
Awesome! Thank you!	15
Probably vallied out man haha	1
Maybe you'll get lucky and it will fall apart before they go through with it.	20
He's 38 he should retire I hope he at least gets traded to a contender	20
Thank [NAME] she did the math for us	15
Y’all out here really believing this and I think that’s the funniest part	1
how blurry this photo is r/mildlyinfuriating	3
We also one because [NAME] straight took that game over late.	4
Lol I can’t wait to end up on this sub one day.	1
And why would I do that? Edit: Thanks for setting up that Walder Frey line for me	15
Plot twist: they don‘t Want to Go To school	10
That's not a healthy way of thinking. Obviously that dude was troubled and, without proper help, he would have done these things regardless.	10
Unless you're the type of person who rolls through relationships every 3-6 months like clockwork	22
I’m glad I’m not the only one who was pedantic enough to notice.	15
Are you daft ... ? That is and always has been the proposal. [NAME] don't listen and don't care though. Fucking dumbass.	2
Fun fact. If you combined North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming and Montana into one state it would have roughly the same population as Puerto Rico!	1

Thank you, next! 	15
Going to the doctor tomorrow for a checkup to make sure everything is normal and hopefully this shit is just in my head.	20

Awesome! I look forward to updating.	0
He must smell terrible when he sweats. That's honestly pretty gross.	11
No R movies or tv shows, no buy from me. But I’m sure people with kids will love it.	18

Well that explains why [NAME] was able to win	4
I never really thought of myself as an ex-[RELIGION] until recently, so many no.	22
Thanks	15
I never went back to the post to see if it was BOA, but I’m not surprised if it was. That was my first guess. 	22
I like it. Ending made me cry happy tears. I don't cry often	18
I just found my new flair. Thanks [NAME].	15
Usually they dont even show up when you call them and they are a rare sight in the city. Good luck finding one.	20
I hope everyone has a nice day.	20
Oh I wasn't offended. ITA with you on the rest.	10
I stand corrected. As I said, wonderful charities. I will always enjoy GDQ, just not revalant to my experience.	17

No one wants the wrong person executed for a crime fool	10
I totally thought that this match would be a draw due to [NAME] interfering. I should never make any picks in the pick'em contest ever again.	4
Excellent, I was wondering about [NAME] the moron recently.	0
I hate you for that title. Thanks a lot. /s Right as I’m about to go to sleep too.	15
Wow. Forget the separation, lawyer up and go straight to divorce. 	26

I don't feel so financially secure	14
"It' kinda ironic that ""Winners"" are actually losers (they haven't realised that yet)"	22

If you can't see how the mass killing of Landlords is related to Communist ideology, there is really no point discussing further.	3
I... don‘t see anything wrong with that?	4
Franchise QB's are leaders who set the tone for the entire lockerroom. [NAME] is a terrible leader.	0
[NAME] FIRED.	2
Except [NAME] still went with the happy ending instead of ending it at the Aningaaq scene.	17
"""You can't stop me"" Ah yes, those playful words when referring to a sexual act..."	2
Yeah, I wouldn't be too surprised by that either. I'm so excited to see or hear SOMETHING though. 	13
My dad loves playing sport......the sport of slam dunking my arse for a touchdown	18
I feel so bad for [NAME]. It was probably hard to concentrate on this match with the things going on in his personal life	25
You credit yourself with acheivment you do not deserve. Not a first and defenitely wont be the last time.	10
I needed this today. Thanks stranger	15

I never knew cringing could be so ...cathartic.	12
Wtf if this is true it’s the funniest thing I’ve read all day.	1
Change your mindset to not expect anything in return, if they do great if not...their loss	8
I agree with you, I just don't believe it will happen.	4
You missed the point 🙃	3
Wow, so he was pulling his own little mini [NAME] scam. Explains why he couldn't use your reporting tool.	17
I just renewed my license today and they didn't check my proof of address, just looked at my us passport, license, and debit card	22
Watching now. Oh wow we both didn't realize how much we hated this guy. This is one of the most quotable episodes by far.	22
WHO WON THIS FIGHT My thoughts: neither side did a good job at explaining their positions and this entire interview was mostly useless	9
And they went to therapy. At least they made active steps to work on their problems unlike a lot of other people.	0
I'm really happy he and [NAME] are finding success	17
I just say I don't know shit. I'm just a ape man on a rock.	3
Thank you thank you!	15

I suppose it is quite frustrating to have someone telling you the sky isn't blue	3
Yeah, sure, but it's beatable. It's made to be beaten, not otherwise. That's what I meant with my speech.	4
I love your art style, that looks fantastic!	18
Welcome to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, where families can be SEPARATED forever	15

I don't mind posts bashing NOED or DS. But I wish this one would make sense or would be funny.	8
Sorry. I know I should be grateful and happy.	24

Pam Beesly and Jim... What a waste.	3
They lived a good life! I honor them by using all their parts	0
I think that had to do more with not wanting to hurt the old man lol	1
The banana speaks! Do you just type one to three words in your comments or do you get an integer overflow if you go for four?	7
I don’t cry, either. It’s weird. I think it’s a personality/mentality thing. Just depends on how your brain is wired I think	22

You freakin wizard, I love this. 	18

And here I am thinking that the animation after surrender/Victory is annoying ;-;	3
Sure but the news article with [NAME] vanishing has been there since the very beginning.	4
Maybe so. Should I try to ask her about it? I'm worried that will only scare her more	14
Is that you, [NAME]?	7
#RejectingIslam because it is the *ideas* [RELIGION] promotes that turned me away from it.	22
Did the words get unbanned?!	7
I am removing this post because of sourcing. Read the sidebar.	10
Read his post again. 'It's more fact based than Fox.' I'm sorry but you might have some extra chromosomes.	24

No he's right, and you're deflecting from his argument.	4
This is stupid	3
why I wonder?	7
Adapt and overcome	5
This is garbage. No. My garbage has more compositional worth than this. Hipster pepto bismol vomit looking trash.	11

I still maintain the packers were a worse team this year.	9
I love this. I really want to hug [NAME] now.	18
They call it the hub and spoke system. They neglected to include a wheel.	10
I’m always reminded by my relatives on my birthday asking me if I have a girlfriend yet. Sorry bro ima yeet out of the social norm.	25

I live in Canterbury haha	17
Happy Together. It feels so natural.	17
Thanks for the clarification, appreciate that.	15

Looks like a poached egg.	4
Glad I tend to post pics of my cats and not myself.	17
I don't think WI is lean red, after 2018 I'd argue for it being either tossup or lean blue.	10

I thought V had great gameplay, but the big character switch that no one asked for really held it back.	22
Or just spend ten seconds around some fire and realize that it's super hot.	22
The loading screen has the circle at the bottom that just keeps spinning. I tried uninstalling the app and that didn't work either.	9
No particular sauce, I'm just kinda tired of having to search that tiny lil speck of pan for at least 2 minutes before I find it.	19
I don’t like [NAME] in the slightest but I hate [NAME] even more. Get her Belcalis	2
Kick him out. Overgrown baby.	2
It's like an Arts school but with dangerous, easily weaponizable spells being flung all over the place!	14
That sounds like an appropriate response. Thank you for saving me the time.	15
"Funny part is There ISNT a wall (but maybe should be) and there ARE already plenty of ""Sensible"" Gun laws"	1
I do this but but feel better in the end because I use it for procrastination. It's a weird combinational to feel better and worse while cleaning.	2
 I have worked at a shitty, south side smoke shop before so I can imagine all of these interactions perfectly hahahaha	1
If Studio MDHR did this, I'd buy it.	20
Such bullshit. Reloading components included? Not that they'd let that stand in subsequent laws if it is.	2
Feeling insecure now	19
Wow, your ex partner sounds exactly like mine.	22

I wouldn't ever make a broad generalization like that. Typical honkies, assuming stuff	3
I don't think either of them is a bad director. They are both bad writers, though.	10
As an [NAME], I apologize for the cranky old conservatives who are probably making ridiculously uninformed comments about your country right now :/	25
How many surprise Pikachu memes are we gonna have this episode? Like 6?	7

They stole my joke, damn them!	3
Sorry my teams gave you your only two losses this season ;)	24
Good luck!	20
Anyone know how I can tune in. Without paying for Blaze Tv subsription. This gonna be good.	7
If we can’t close these type of games at home, we don’t deserve the playoffs. 	4
I will say that her housing bill left a very bad taste in my mouth, and this is coming from someone with a very high opinion of [NAME].	11
Yep, you can go around crashing into things and run people over and completely get away with it. 	4
You said it baby, can't wait to see what marvelous wonders the rest of 2019 will bring!	7
Couldn’t agree more	10
Like wtf how is that angle 114 degrees	7

You don't really work for the TSA if they aren't paying you. You are a slave. Go home.	2

I'm more worried about it randomly saying daddy across the top ... Like that's normal	14
>!I always assume that Motoyasu's team changes once every week or something.!<	8

I used the call screening on my sister for a laugh.. she was not as amused as I was :)	9
I realised after I typed it, but I left it up. I feel sometimes in life, you just gotta take the L. 	22
want* a source on that, sorry.	24
Seriously, it really made me happy! I hope when OP scrolled through she felt a little tingle of happiness too.	17
Same. I was not rooting for the Pats. I WAS rooting against the chiefs. The AFC West is ours and ours alone :)	8
Oh, [NAME], don't bring THAT story up!	3
Didn't know they were doing matches on smaller pitch in the combine to see how they do with less reaction time. Thought that was interesting.	22
Fat is always unhealthy, and never a sign of beauty.	10
This is not r/lostredditors material if we just try to find something stupid on it.	10
Old timbermill. Was that the long payload defense and attack?	7

Well they got removed so I’m not sure if I want to see it anyway.	10
He is sacrificing himself for our sins. [NAME] bless.	5
That doesn't sound right but I don't know enough about stars to dispute it	3
Well don’t complain here about another media outlet lol	1
Look on the bright side, you might never need to worry about that ever again.	20
Oh wow this is good to know, it was always my go-to spicy ketchup when I make frozen fries at home.	13
I didn’t understand because it’s not dark mode	10

So more [NAME]? No thanks. Love the guys, but that’s for side projects. 	18
They are all good right now. Pick the one that interests you and enjoy yourself.	17
I rarely like or comment on YouTube. But I make hella playlists so I guess I use it more as a tool than a community.	4
I'm just glad we'll be getting either [NAME] or [NAME]. They both seem like they'll be beasts and it'll fill our greatest position of need	17
Unlikely, but who knows? Memory speed rarely makes a difference in gaming, but I've seen stranger things. 	7
by deep pockets do you mean the Fleshlight?	6
It's delicate, so it's clear for those flesh toned jeggings [NAME].	22
I love it! Cute sprite work....	18
Was already mad when it wasn’t center. Then when it got knock over, i was furious. Damn machine has no brains.	3

Good luck on the change.	15
I know it's like this hipster phrase it's so stupid like you're not from the south you dumb motherfuker.	2
It’s not about the money, it’s all about the love of the game.	22
Thanks for the reply! I’ll probably just smoke, as you said, once maybe twice a month. Thanks again!	15
Sometimes those are the only options. Laughing makes other people feel better at least so that's what you gotta do.	5
Not my opinion either, but the soundtrack is easily one of the best parts of the game. It’s incredible.	0
Text to speech is a very very bad idea. You do not want to give 4,000 people full control over what gets said out loud on a stream. 	3
Thanks I hate it.	15
what the fuck do you learn in first grade that’s so important anyway?	2
>Have a good time debating the people in your head, looks like you're having fun.	17

They said Texas! #Woooooo TEXAS	13
Thank you! 💓❤	15
I bet you could get away with this at work just fine.	4
We've been pretty good for the most part the last 5 years. I mean, [NAME] saying [NAME] betrayed him isn't ideal but could be worse. 	4
The ending was so badass as a young kid! He wasnt even in his mech!	0
Signed up! This is brilliant!	0
Former [NAME]? I've been scared already by [NAME] who were former d-line	7
[NAME] is known to make a short video hella fucking long. Not many want to see even more people do that. I'll stick to [NAME].	3
As a society we should be ashamed of the fact that this is even a question. Let the suffering stop obviously.	12
Which one is he playing?	7
This article is stupid.	3
I would think that I hope the Wilpons die.	20
It’s a cruel thing to say to someone with depression.	11

Yeah! Despite being from the east coast I've never been in the car when it's hailing so it was a full on argument. Thank you!	15
Well I WISH SOMEONE WOULD'VE TOLD ME THAT	8

Idk why you got downvoted but heres an upvote	6

The constant pressure definitely isn't helping. I'm already on anti-depressants, but I am terrified of PPD.	14
My uncle was hit by some kids doing the bird box challenge a few weeks back. It’s ridiculous.	3
Yea this past season her outfits were horrid	11

Hey congrats man, that’s what I’m hoping happens as well!	15
These were one of the worst commentators I have ever been forced to listen to. The jokes were so cringe-worthy.	11
It would work just fine. I wear medium shirts and a small or medium jersey fits me great.	4
I haven’t read the Quran and I doubt you have either so I can’t agree or disagree with this statement.	6
And just the “stop looking at me” was so old school. It was nice!	4
Triple P Positive Parenting Program is excellent.	0
I think this qualifies as r/prorevenge, honestly. Dude needs to face consequences more often, otherwise he will keep trampling over people’s boundaries.	4
Omg enough of all the damn hashtags, it’s not 2016 anymore	2
No, not related to [NAME]. I forget where we found it. It was in some legal documentation on WISDOJ (I think).	10
I was more concerned that your comment held a frame of reference assuming it was real.	5
Beautiful. Up there with that retro '14 Timbers kit for my favorite non-Atlanta MLS kits.	0

Thank you!	15
[NAME] and [NAME] aren't cousins in this timeline, I believe. Just best friends.	4
I'm really excited for [NAME]. He seems to be continually improving in this stretch of games. I'm hoping he stays up once [NAME] is healthy.	20

The last hour is great, but I would definitely say to at least leave 15 minutes before close so you can avoid the crowds in the street.	0

There’s no evidence that 12-step programs work any better than no program, so you’re not missing anything if you quit. Good luck.	20
I personally wish that they stuck with the spin offs but if their happy I’m good.👌	8

On reflection I might've been harsh on [NAME], but Bandai's existence was forgettable like a swing flashback in Naruto.	22

I wondered where the quote about “supporting your azz” and was very pleased to finally find the train wreck that said it.	26

Lost finger how?	26
Bahahahahaha the life of a fish parent!	1
Swear i have seen this before? had it been reposted?	6

Wow that's a really great explanation. Makes sense!	0
Your manager sounds like an idiot. Not saying he/she is. Just sounds like it from this.	2

I love many fanarts of this paring, but this is one of my favorite ones. :)	18
That's the worst feeling haha	1

No, I have been avoiding doing anything until it's actually fixed because I don't want to give them any reason to drag their feet.	10
I think most people have listened to bohemian rhapsody at some point thank you very much	15
I wouldn't say age would stop it just lessen the affect of it but probably start to notice it around mid to late 30's.	22
You should be embarrassed. Not only because you are a adulterer but because you are a pedo for thinking of your son.	12
I don’t know why but watching this makes me super happy!	17
They don’t like to be excluded from anything	10
One of my worst nightmares. Ugh.	14

My poor space bar takes an awful bashing with all the pausing in a Squidge vid	11
I think this is the clearest that it has ever been described. Thank you for this. It nailed it, for me anyway....	15
What kind of frankenshoe...	7
Every time I get a staff kill, it feels like seeing a shooting star <3 Yeah, it definitely sucks.	11
I hate these memes because [NAME] never cared if he did or didn't have a nose.	2
The miracle was just that. Because we all know the Vikings would fail the next game.	26
No problem, glad to help.	17
I love [NAME] and how openly she is in supporting him to run	18
Wow he is... ugly.	3
I love you like a love song, baby. And if you know that song, it's now in your head.	18
its funny because they dont even do anything at the look out tower but stargaze	1
Am i missing something or is this an antijoke that doesn't belong here?	7
He's always had the tools to do this, which is why he can be frustrating at times.	3
Welp , that statement is not very wrong.	10
[NAME]: I'm sorry that happened. I hope you weren't totally friendless on your 30th!	20
Every other way sounds wrong. SPR for life.	22
Best doggo ever	0

"I honestly don't understand why everyone thinks he needs a rework because he's not ""fun to play"" in the worst game mode."	6
Is that bottom trey filled with beer? If so, how did he acquire them?	6
Of course he will lie cheat and steal to make him self relevant to the public. Horrible person.	14
Id rather have them be physically ok and make amends with [NAME] later than have one without the ability to communicate efficiently forever but have their feelings alright.	5
They put him on a minutes restriction for some reason, guessing cause he's not in really good shape?	7
TIL cheddar cheese didn't originate in the U.S. Thank you!	15
Like I said previously I realise they weren't commonly called asylum seekers until recently. However that doesn't mean that previously they weren't asylum seekers	22
Thanks! I had a more standard name but then realized I didn't want to be findable on Reddit.	15
[NAME] is a hungry little bastard.	2
I had no idea it would hit me as hard as it did. It really changed my view.	22
Meh, it just keeps players from diving in taking stupid damage. (At least it should.)	4
I’d love an ג׳‬וליאן if you have time! Good job keep up the hard work	0
Attempt to con the senate. This should continue to be entertaining	1
It’s not satisfying at all. If this wasn’t [NAME] it wouldn’t be popular. Interesting timing considering the [NAME] debacle too.	10
Same boat here, man.	4
What a baby...	0
I never understood the point of parole. Seems to me like an expensive way to increase recidivism.	6
Lol he was actually roasting OG fans that lick his arse, not [NAME] himself. Take the upvote.	22
And there you have it, the left who argue with personal attacks and cnn buzzwords.	2

I met him! He graduated from my high school and came back when I was a freshman to talk to us in PE. Really nice guy.	0
It's actually illegal to do this. Only allowed if absolutely unavoidable.	10
Idk, r/Tinder has plenty of posts to do with awful men too lol	1
Because they enjoy their toxic umoderated cesspool, apparently. Either way i'm done trying to care.	17
Dont blame em. They should force change to get done what needs to be done	5
This is something that has to be learned from experience. Don't be hard on yourself!	5
> His face, mate. He thought he was a goner. Properly lol'd at that and reading all [NAME]' bits in his accent	1
No because to them this disabled boy is faceless. It’s easier to digest our hate and vitriol without thinking about it.	9

PS. I love my aunt! She’s one of the reasons I went into “nursins.”	18
They never will until it affects them directly, and by then it's already in the end game for us :/	10
I think that's just natural, humans weren't really intended to fly by nature so I guess it just feels wrong or something, idk	10
> you're probably a little bit of a closeted nazi yourself. I'm just SHOCKED that someone named [NAME] might be a fascist	26
I despise [NAME] and all his cronies	2
looks like we got a double win today!!	13
Don’t do a long distance thing, not worth it and a waste of time	5

Same here. I had a lot of swelling but not abnormal pain.	4

Can't believe [NAME] has been in the league that long...	26
Tell your husband. Its lies by omissions. Who are you to pick and choose what HE wants to know.	2
Happy to see that you're in recovery	5
Because they are triggered. I’m just stating my opinion. It’s a bit fun.	1
That's the problem I'm pointing, the media use stupid clicbait names and people get dumber and dumber.	2
One of the best pubs in London. Even more likely inside!!	0

Also Strike Anywhere. This thread makes my heart happy. <3	17
Conservative is massively brigaded on an hourly basis. Unfortunately, it requires strict moderation or else it is unreadable.	9
I love [NAME]. He’s just going to keep getting better.	18
Omg, your screen name made me lol!!	1
That is not accurate based on the conversation i had with Mr. [NAME] today.	10
Ah does look fun	1
I'd smash	2
How can we send money to you?	6
That whole thread makes me want to shake babies.	8
Glad you came to your senses. Go feel uncomfortable about Lola bunny in Space Jam again.	17
Yep California, I would've been surprised if they cleared him.	4
Did you even read the post? Literally the first line says she doesn't do anything remotely house wifey.	7
LSD or the fungal kind? Out of curiosity	7
Sure that's a good way. Unfortunately, I am not a gamer per se.	4
Nope, not a [NAME] fan at all.	10

Well 216 is out now and Im crying. [NAME] why?	25
I'd enjoy a nice warm hug. Along with a delightful conversation. But that works too.	8
Ohh I love bag designs	18
They are so old and so predictable that they can NOT see how “silly” they look when they post articles like this......	9
Then I’m sorry but this game really isn’t for you. Progression like that would ruin the base of what this game is.	10
YOUR momentum doesn't help you, its the direction you're aiming and THEIR momentum that does. they were probably backing up when that happened.	10
Sorry I dropped this /sノ( ゜-゜ノ)	24

DID YOU KNOW THAT CASHEWS COME FROM A FRUIT!?!?	7
Ahh okay, that makes a lot of sense. But you're totally right, we've just gotta work as hard as possible.	4
Can you go see her in person?	7
I find that relatable: I too am terrified of myself.	14
Been off since November 29th. I would rather be working and making money. Home gets boring	9
spark up bro. Welcome.	15
Yeah, this just sounds like the usual Seattle understatement.	4
This is really helpful, thanks!	15
Right now, it feels like a good thing but not a great thing. I don't love it... But I don't hate it. 	10
we can only hope	20
Looks like we found his natural position.	13
Yeah that helps. Thanks :)	15
