Consider this a digital hug. Not too long, not too short, just enough to make you feel a human connection and some comfort. :)	3
Thanks for sharing. You could definitely post some of your other tales.	3
We're not exactly short on white homophobes either though.	0
Whats your height and weight out of curiosity?	6
Gotta get 'email all! Edit: stupid autocorrect	4
Rule 10 is to make it clear that people who violate the spirit of the rules without breaking the letter will be punished in the same way.	3
"I honestly don't understand why everyone thinks he needs a rework because he's not ""fun to play"" in the worst game mode."	6
Really good point here. Thanks.	3
Is that bottom trey filled with beer? If so, how did he acquire them?	6
Of course he will lie cheat and steal to make him self relevant to the public. Horrible person.	2
Id rather have them be physically ok and make amends with [NAME] later than have one without the ability to communicate efficiently forever but have their feelings alright.	3
You're cool	4
No problem. If you read it let me know what you think!	4
They put him on a minutes restriction for some reason, guessing cause he's not in really good shape?	6

"""I SAID, [NAME]!"""	4
[NAME] is a hungry little bastard.	0
I had no idea it would hit me as hard as it did. It really changed my view.	6
His best season was a luck filled one. He'd be nothing more than what [NAME] and [NAME] already offer but with worse defense and a worse bat.	4
Meh, it just keeps players from diving in taking stupid damage. (At least it should.)	3
I’d love an ג׳‬וליאן if you have time! Good job keep up the hard work	3
Attempt to con the senate. This should continue to be entertaining	3
It’s not satisfying at all. If this wasn’t [NAME] it wouldn’t be popular. Interesting timing considering the [NAME] debacle too.	0
Same boat here, man.	3
What a baby...	3
Yeah I think it largely depends on how you fall. In Judo that’s one of the main things they practice.	4
And it needs to keep pushing harder and harder to the left in order to wash away all the crap that's been enacted since [NAME] got into office.	4
Actually there were blacks in the SS. Kind of an odd analogy.	4

And there you have it, the left who argue with personal attacks and cnn buzzwords.	0

Yes of mine worry, no one liked mine either. 	5
I’m going to die right now I’m so scared tears and snot everywhere	2

Lol. Thanks for the link.	3
Not as nice as [NAME].	0
Love is war	4
I met him! He graduated from my high school and came back when I was a freshman to talk to us in PE. Really nice guy.	3

> His face, mate. He thought he was a goner. Properly lol'd at that and reading all [NAME]' bits in his accent	3
No because to them this disabled boy is faceless. It’s easier to digest our hate and vitriol without thinking about it.	5
Definitely fake. Looks like bad CGI in a movie.	1
Or better yet, on the woman who will let ME play with them!	4
Yah that's what is stopping me. I would have to wire all throw my car or go into my cars electrical which doesn't seem worth it.	4
Can we all pitch in and buy this place instead of the Baltimore House?	4
Such season 1 vibes and I love it.	3

Me me big sad.	5
Can holiday just stop fucking shooting? I can’t wait till he gets traded.	6
