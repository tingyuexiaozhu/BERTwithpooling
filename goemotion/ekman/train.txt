Great album! üëä	3

Not really, it can bind *itself* (though not future incarnations) otherwise none of the laws would mean anything.	0
After listening to the lecture, I‚Äôve concluded that there‚Äôs no way this kid isn‚Äôt a redditor	5
Sadly, that theory is plausible in the lds inc realm of thinking.	4

Shit, they don‚Äôt go down!? That blows	4

Oh yes! You're great.	3
Well that makes it easy. Thanks again. I'll look into it.	3

No, a plot hole means that your story lacks logical consistency	0
Not too much, I‚Äôm talking to a girl right now that‚Äôs 5 years younger than me lol.	3
Spiritual shorthand. You nailed it. That term says it all. They've become so practiced in it that it has become meaningless.	3
You might be right. Not everybody is going to find their way the same as I did.	3
They do get an awful lot of upvotes, so they seem to have at least some support from others.	3
A stunning place, you will need lots of cuddles to stay warm though!	3
Anybody think maybe we‚Äôre the mystery team in on [NAME]? At this point I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised.	5
Posting someone elses camp on reddit? Really? haha.	3

Thank you! It sucks but not being a zombie is so worth it!	3
This makes me unfathomably angry.	0
Yeah. Why throw a wrench into a handy conviction?	5
So, just a super verbose tone trolling?	5
so [NAME] isn't necessarily as dumb as she literally appears... I've always liked her for some reason.	3
Can we get a moment of silence for the passing of the video game boy?	4

Rule 2, 3, and 7. Impressive. Goodbye.	3
Thank you for this video	3
I love humans	3

i agree he is pretty average but the guy i was responding him was calling him ugly which i find pretty ridiculous	3
I was trying to make the point that the patient is still having a seizure; it's just not visible because they are paralyzed.	2
I liked the magic but it's really superfluous. Dr [NAME] is literally just ironman with a bad accent, like why does this exist	3
It looks fun as hell too, from what I can tell. I‚Äôd love to give it a whirl	3
The amount of people there saying water is free is astounding. How out of touch with reality can you be?	5

Get some colloidal silver and put that in your eye so it doesn‚Äôt get infected!!!	3
For the love of [NAME] gobget the tweezers!	3
I think you're right. She has oodles of cash and young grandchildren to enjoy. Going through that hideous gauntlet again probably isn't that appealing.	3
She's cute but she's got that crazy look, the type of girl that would cut your d*ck off. üò¨	3
I have, I've always wanted to celebrate Christmas and actually have a more closer family	3
Ok thanks for your help!	3

This South Florida girl loves Jaxons Ice Cream. Seeing the kitchen sink makes me want to drive home.	3

I got confused for a second and thought why would you pay for your ex's trip	5
One of the greatest moments of my life, to date	3

Damn it, I only have 6 comments on this sub, I don‚Äôt qualifyüòû	4
You are the parent your grandson deserves. Your daughter will regret the pain she has caused.	4

For futures sake, if someone is in the Midwest, where would we opt to play?	5

How old is this? I remember he was hugely FB popular back in like 2011. Him and [NAME].	5
Well he hasn‚Äôt dont anything good ever. So sorry I‚Äôm not very excited about this trade.	4

First I was afraid, I was petrified...	2
Don‚Äôt fall for it.	3
I am sorry but how in the hell is there no added time added ?	5

This story puts me in the mood for a jolly rancher	3
I like it, more please.	3
Sorry, not from her. But from family and friends. We were open to each other about everything.	4
I'm sorry man sounds bad	4

Thank you for responding with truth to a top comment that is intentionally very misleading	3

That‚Äôs horrible. Only religion could make an otherwise normal person want to show a torture and murder video to a child.	2
We‚Äôre still commenting on a video of a dog farting and a cat throwing up right?	5
And are millennials supposed to be attracted to these? If anything I'd be more offended than encouraged to join.	5
I like how she was trying to stop the fight, then just gave up and started throwing them too.	3
lol I was thinking the same hahah	3

Good one.	3
Amazing detail with the hot dog in the virgins hand.	3

I don‚Äôt think they really thought through the ramifications of putting a bunch of angry women through rigorous physical exercise with weapons. That uprising would be glorious!	3

[NAME]. Am I doing this right?	5
I didn't even cringe at this, I unironically love doggo mems	3
It's viewed as unfashionable and lower class. Personally I think they feel great. Who gives a shit what other people think?	3
Yes! I play both, because I like the combat of one and everything else in the other.	3
such a deep and powerful tweet	3
This is the best creepy pasta I have **EVER** read.	3
Same! Makes me want to hug them and feed them milk.	3

This guy gets it...	3
I absolutely love it that EVERYONE is scoring... please keep this up for the rest of the season.	3
I‚Äôm not going to live in the middle of nowhere. I like Chicago.	0

We're like bad luck lightning rods. Everybody around us is safe	4
The best feeling ever was when class was over and it never got to your turn, so you didnt have to present until the next day	3
Yikes on the sauce!!	5
yesterday was a fucking travesty to the game of basketball	0
Huh, I wonder why the NFL doesn't have the umpire line up there anymore?	5
Thank [NAME].	3
I completely agree with mondawggg. Playing the petty way instead of discussing the issue with him directly is so much more productive....wait	3
That‚Äôs a new level of blonde I never knew existed!	5
I honestly do not know. Chastise them for their hardness of heart and presumptiveness I suppose. I guess that is what [NAME] would do.	0
Oh hahaha, is it a reputable vendor?	3
That Man has one of the coolest tattoos on his knee I've ever seen.	3
Looks just like the snow we've been getting in Halifax recently! (Canada)	3
Do you want to be promoted to Secreatary of State for the US?	5

In the cap era no goalie has played as much as [NAME] has the last 2 years on a per games basis	3
I was very tunnel visioned at first haha didn‚Äôt even notice the arm	3

That's interesting! Here I am having been saying I grew up near the original all my life. I will correct my story.	3
We had a baby, it's hard to find the time to take them down.	4
I stopped watching after I had to suffer through a whole episode without [NAME] removing his shirt	3

This kid now: fun yay hahoo This kid as a grownup: I regret everything	4
Was it? Honestly I didnt get it, even asked some other people and they didnt get. I guess color me ignorant. Care to explain?	5
The World Between Worlds veered worryingly close to this territory. Luckily it was handled well.	3

Nah, I know why I am depressed, and I'm sorry to say it has nothing to do with you.	4
I kind of want to try that now actually. With some chocolate added I think it could work.	3
It‚Äôs an imperfect poll demographic group skewing erroneously towards a ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. [NAME] was incredible this week.	0
I wonder how many didn't get the joke	5
I won't stop crying üò≠	4
MOTHERFUCKING FLYING MONKEYS, AHHHHHHHHGHGHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!	0
Yeah I doubt the woman would post about it whilst still in his bed. She'd wait until she was dumped then complain about it at least.	5
I'm sorry you had a bad experience, that's horrible. But that number saved one of my friends lives. Different for everyone	2
She‚Äôs my favorite too. She is indeed hella cute.	3
Makes sense, thanks!	3
Reality is often disappointing	4

I hate these cakes so much.	1
I'm thankful every day I was in school before the Internet, smart phones and social media.	3

You got whooshed fair and square. Take your medicine.	3
This is maybe the lamest way you can say that.	0
dont get down on yourself, early NC is very daunting. good luck! (im 11 years NC from nmom....life is good!)	3

If she canf even protect herself what the fuck is she doing in a business that protects others.	0

I‚Äôm definitely leaving him. I have a 0 tolerance for cheating and won‚Äôt be staying for it to happen again	0

I don't need a pogram. The best targ killers are other targs	0
edit: black gays and trans in the ball scene started it, much like a lot of our gay slang	3

Lets just say its probably cheaper to just hope a more positive outlook reflects on your out-look.	3
Oh my [NAME].	5
I failed with my play on words. Oh well, can't win them all	4
Comedown is only a tenth of addiction. Addiction is when you find a high that you love more than yourself. Be careful.	3
Thanks I will try to delete the multiples. Good luck on everything.	3

Did he died?	5
